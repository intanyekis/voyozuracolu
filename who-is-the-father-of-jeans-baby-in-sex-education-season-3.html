But it would be absolutely beside us if we didn’t mention the biggest one of them all.</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_ylkw5ume7><a class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_d2c5my href=#>Jean Milburn</a>‘s pregnancy was the focal point of her story in the third season. Throughout her pregnancy, she faced many interpersonal&nbsp;challenges,&nbsp;such as fighting with her son as well as trying to figure out her relationship with her partner, Jakob. However, once the baby was&nbsp;delivered,&nbsp;all of those issues went away, but she was left with an even larger one: Who is the father of this new human being?</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_2mxy15fzl>Although the answer to this question was not revealed in the last episode of Sex Education season 3, we sure do have some pretty convincing evidence that may give you the answer to this burning question. Everything we speculate&nbsp;about is&nbsp;right here.</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_9otlp0q0f>As of right now, the answer is inconclusive. The father of Jean’s baby girl ,Joy, along with many other unsolved issues, is one of the cliffhangers that were left with us this&nbsp;season,&nbsp;given the fact that Jean did not reveal her results to the audience. Even still, there was a huge hint given to us that most likely indicates that Jakob is not the father of Joy — the mysterious cuff link.</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_rosq7tqrp>Jakob finding a cuff link in the house of Jean Milburn is probably one of the biggest indicators of him not being the father. While we don’t know who the item belonged to, it could be assumed that it was left by Jean’s ex-husband, Remi, when he visited and fooled around with her in the second season. Assuming the hookup was unprotected, it’s possible that Remi is Joy’s father.</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_dlc0ncor4>Even if we were to erase the discovery of the cuff link, there was still tons of foreshadowing that was right in front of our face all along. The first being Jakob’s heartbreak.</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_c3oz1zkfz>Toward the end of the season, we got to see a more vulnerable side to Jakob as he expressed the grief he felt toward the end of his late wife’s life. He expressed that before she passed away, she was unfaithful in their marriage, which broke his heart completely. Because of this, he struggles with trusting Jean wholly and is the reason why Jean took a paternity test in the first place. With all this in mind, this particular foreshadowing does seem like the perfect setup to reveal the truth that Jakob’s heart probably can’t take… but let’s explore another one.</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_4p2ncwclm>The second foreshadowing would be how much <a class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_d2c5my href=#>Otis</a> and his new (sort of) half-sister Ola didn’t get along upon the joining of these two families. The two were both used to having their own space, which explains the bickering at the beginning of the move. Ola was rather intrusive with Otis’ belongings, and Otis wasn’t willing to budge.</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_6peojijtt>Nevertheless, by the end of the season, we see that they are getting along just fine. However, these teens’ initial tension may have been a forewarning that the blending of this family was never meant to be. Even still, the biggest forewarning has yet to come.</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_wo98jpy3u>The third and final foreshadowing would be the treehouse built by Jakob but being passed on to Otis. As we know, upon Jakob moving in, he decided to build the baby a treehouse for them to play in. Jakob got pretty far in building the structure of the house, but ultimately didn’t finish because of various things, including <a class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_d2c5my href=# rel>Jean’s near-death experience</a> post-pregnancy.</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_g871h5cbd>With this in mind, there’s truthfully no greater indicator of Jakob not being Joy’s father than this because the treehouse essentially symbolized a new beginning for, not just the family, but especially for Jakob. Jakob no longer manning the project seems to equate to himself and Ola missing out on being the ones to experience this new beginning in the end, leaving Otis and Jean, the ones who are blood-related to Joy — the only ones to reap this new chapter.</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_i0mdqa15c>Our evidence may be extremely convincing, but it goes without saying that we’re going to have to wait until<a class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_d2c5my href=# rel> season 4</a> to know just who the father is to Jean’s new daughter. But whichever outcome it is, we know it’s going to be so juicy and a major plot in the fourth season.</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_pvf5c5p4b>Until then, be sure to watch every episode of&nbsp;Sex Education&nbsp;season 3 streaming right now only on <a class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_d2c5my href=# rel=noopener>Netflix</a>.</p><figure data-mm-id=_v23kc9sdf readability=1><p lang=en dir=ltr>Next.
