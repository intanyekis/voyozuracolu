You’ve probably fantasized about falling in love and getting swept off your feet, whether you realize it or not.</p><p>The Notebook isn’t just beautiful for this reason. It also includes two more elements: a teen heartthrob (did I say teen? It’s OK.) The queen of romantic comedies, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams.</p><p>We almost believe their successes and losses, feelings and heartbreaks are real since they are such a star-struck couple.</p><p>That is how chemistry happens. So, let’s take a trip down memory lane today and watch this wonderful video. Finally, don’t forget to bring your Kleenex.</p><p>This is going to be an emotional journey on memory lane for you.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return To Hogwarts’ Fans Spot A Big Mistake" href=# rel=bookmark>Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return To Hogwarts’ Fans Spot A Big Mistake</a></p><h2><strong>The Notebook Plot</strong></h2><p>The Notebook begins with a guy reading a story to a woman in a nursing home. Allie Hamilton and Noah Calhoun, two young lovers, meet at a carnival one day and fall in love.</p><p>Despite the fact that the two are in love, Allie’s parents oppose the relationship and relocate Allie. Allie meets Lon and becomes engaged after years of waiting for any sign (such as letters) from Noah. Allie, on the other hand, still harbors feelings for Noah.</p><p>Despite her engagement to Lon, Allie decides to pay a visit to Noah after seeing his photo in the papers in front of the house he promised to rebuild (and did). It’s clear they have feelings for each other right away.</p><p>Allie should now choose among Lon, whom she had already planned to marry, and Noah, whom she secretly desires. Allie chooses Noah, her genuine love, over Lon. Noah and Allie have a good life together and die peacefully side by side in a nursing facility.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Harry Potter Reunion: Emma Watson Almost Left The Saga?

Oliver And James Phelps Tricked Fans</a></p><h2><strong>What makes The Notebook so special?</strong></h2><p>You might be wondering if this is a generic sad narrative after reading the plot above. But what makes it so unique? You will already know the solution if you have seen it. But, if not, allow us to assist you.</p><p>It is based on a factual story, for starters. Well, Nicholas Sparks was inspired to write this novel by his ex-wife Cathy’s grandparents’ love story.</p><p>The couple had been together for over 60 years when Sparks was inspired to write this book after hearing their story about how they met for the first time.</p><p>“But, though their narrative was fantastic, what I most remember from that day is the way they were treating one other,” Sparks writes on his website. The way he looked at her, how he held her hand, how he got her tea and cared about her.</p><p>I recall watching them together and thought to myself that after 60 years of marriage, these two individuals were still treating each other the same way my wife and I did after 12 hours. \</p><p>What a lovely present they’d given us on our first day of marriage, I thought, to teach us that real love can last forever.” And these were the emotions he hoped to convey through his novel, which was subsequently magnificently brought to life on screen by Allie and Noah.</p><p>Furthermore, the story is quite relatable. Even in today’s era of technology and social media, we’re sure you’ve had or still get someone who can connect to Noah or Allie.</p><p>And the film is so realistic. We expect the same tropes and theatrics when we hear about another sweet, tragic, rich girl poor boy narrative as viewers. But that isn’t the case here.</p><p>Have you seen the well-known rain scene? Or how about the breathtaking lake landscape, complete with swarms of gorgeous white swans? Also, Noah and Allie’s kisses, both innocent and not so innocent? Here, you’ll understand what we mean by “genuine” and “raw feelings.”</p><p>The soul-stirring soundtrack from The Notebook is also worth mentioning. It includes some of the greatest successes of the time, including Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, and Benny Goodman, as well as Aaron Zigman’s scores – jazz and pop tracks from the 1940s. The primary title track, Allie Returns, Overture, and Noah’s Journey are among Zigman’s orchestral compositions.</p><p>I’ll Be Seeing You by the Holidays, Alabamy Home by Ellington, and Always and Always by Goodman are all beautiful, melodious compositions. Glenn Miller, Rex Stewart, the Ellingtonians, and Jimmy Durante provide additional contributions to the film’s character.</p><p>The power of love is intertwined with the beautiful backdrops where The Notebook was shot. Beautiful lakes, huge oaks, flocks of birds, and the never-ending rain are just a few of the elements that help tie the story together!</p><p>The Notebook, which was released on June 25, 2004, in the United States and Canada, made $13,464,745 in its first weekend. It earned a staggering $115,603,229 globally, making it one of the most successful romantic dramas of all time.</p><p>Even the protagonists’ performances received a lot of praise from both critics and the audience. While some people adore The Notebook for its unrestrained romanticism, others adore the film’s stunning photography, which they describe as “striking in its rich, saturated effects.” In June 2010, Entertainment Weekly named Allie and Noah to their list of “100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.”</p><p>The Notebook, on the other hand, was included in The Periodical’s list of the 25 Hottest Movies Ever. While Us Weekly named it the 30th most romantic film of all time, Boston.com rated it as the third most romantic film of all time. So many awards for a romantic comedy? Isn’t that reason enough just to make the film what it is now?</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="911 Lone Star Season 3: Episode Release Schedule?

Where To Watch?</a></p><h2><strong>Characters in “The Notebook”</strong></h2><p>Allie appears to be the ideal prim and proper, well-behaved, wealthy young lady when we see her. She enjoys drawing and writing and is learning to play the piano.</p><p>She is a touch fiery, despite having been raised in a conservative, rich family. She isn’t interested in following her mother’s rules.</p><p>She appears unhappy because she is subdued in a rigorous and regulated setting, and we only witness her opening up to her adventurous, passionate, and free-spirited side after meeting Noah.</p><p>Noah, on the other hand, is a carefree young guy who spends his time on the porch with his father reading poetry and passing the time.</p><p>He is a passionate, simple, moody, and dedicated man who enjoys his existence and is not overly concerned with worldly wealth. Allie pulls out his wit and charm, despite his inherent quietness.</p><p>Noah’s primary purpose was to keep her happy from the time he met her. He is still crazy for Allie and, yes, is finally able to make her his own after all these years apart.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="What’s the accurate Net Worth of Jamie Lynn Spears?" href=# rel=bookmark>What’s the accurate Net Worth of Jamie Lynn Spears?</a></p><h2><strong>Did Noah And Allie End Up Together?</strong></h2><p>In the closing scene of the film on Netflix UK, there is an unexpected turn. In the closing shot, Noah and Allie are portrayed sleeping together.</p><p>The nurse scene, which signified that they were both dead, is simply erased. Instead, the image transitions to a flight of birds, implying that Noah and Allie did not perish.</p><h2><strong>The Notebook Ending</strong></h2><p>James Gardner and Gena Rowlands (the elderly individuals from the trailer) are older versions of Noah and Allie. Allie’s fiancé allows her to leave him for Noah since he knows she still loves him.</p><p>Alzheimer’s disease prevents Older Allie from recalling anything about their history in the present. Noah tells their narrative from a notebook that Allie wrote for him as a gift.</p><p>She can only recall the story for five minutes at a time, requiring him to read to her continually. In the end, Allie remembers Noah, and the two-pass away in their sleep while holding hands.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvToZxmpp%2BpsqO7zqRknqaUnruoecSxp6WZmaOypXuVcGtxZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tinashe-kachingwe-wiki-married-boyfriend-net-worth-family-bio.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tinashe Kachingwe Wiki, Bio, Boyfriend, Married, Net worth, Age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./summer-walker.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>nobody else | Summer Walker Lyrics, Meaning &amp;amp; Videos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
