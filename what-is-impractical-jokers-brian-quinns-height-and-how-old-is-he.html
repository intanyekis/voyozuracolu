During their time at the institution, all four boys were not class clowns as one would expect; rather, they were intelligent, respectful, hardworking and diligent. The quartet were also not close friends; they, however, ran in the same circles and joined the same improv comedy group in junior year. After finishing high school, all four men headed to different parts of the country for college. They later returned to New York where they ran into each other and subsequently decided to set up a comedy troupe. They spent the first six months practicing in the basement of a house that belonged to one of them. They later began performing publicly and uploaded their sketches to YouTube.</p><p>For nearly a decade, Quinn and his three buddies found it difficult making much head way. The four pals later came up with the novel idea of a hidden-camera show where they prank themselves rather than members of the public. Known as Impractical Jokers, the show basically features the four buddies daring each other to do something embarrassing. If one refuses, or cannot complete his task, he is subjected to an even more embarrassing punishment. Impractical Jokers debuted on truTV in 2011 and has grown to become one of the highest-rated comedy shows in the U.S. Quinn and his pals have also embarked on several lucrative tours, selling out legendary venues such as the O2 Arena and the Madison Square Garden.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brian Quinn has a net worth estimated at $5 million and this primarily stems from his lucrative comedy career. Apart from what he and his buddies make on their hit comedy show, the Tenderloins have also made a small fortune from their successful tours. For instance, their Cranjis McBasketball World Comedy Tour of 2019 grossed more than $9.5 million.</p><p>On an individual note, Quinn has also invested in a Staten Island brewery known as Rubsam & Horrmann Brewing Company. R&H was founded in 1888 and has brewed over 100,000 kegs of beer. The company later went moribund before Quinn decided to revamp it. The comic was motivated to do so due to his love for beer as well as his passion for his hometown of Staten Island. R&H relaunched in September 2019 and carries three signature brews.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-brian-quinns-height></span><strong>What Is Brian Quinn’s Height?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brian Quinn has an average, medium-sized build.
