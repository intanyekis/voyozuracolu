One of them is singer John Mayer who also tends to use his personal experiences to create some of his biggest hits. Taylor Swift and John Mayer were linked to each other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">between December 2009 and March 2010</a>, after they collaborated on John Mayer’s single "Half of My Heart." Back then, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift revealed</a> that she has "been such a big fan of John for such a long time" and that she was thrilled to work with him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Real Reason Taylor Swift And John Mayer Broke Up">The Real Reason Taylor Swift And John Mayer Broke Up</a></span></p><p>Today, we're taking a closer look at Taylor Swift and John Mayer's relationship. Which songs did the two musicians write about each other — keep on scrolling to find out!</p><h2 id=which-taylor-swift-song-is-about-john-mayer>Which Taylor Swift Song Is About John Mayer?</h2><p>The most well-known Taylor Swift song that fans believe is about John Mayer is "Dear John" from her 2010 album Speak Now. Apart from the fact that Taylor Swift is singing about a John, it is, in particular, the lyrics: "Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong / Don’t you think 19 is too young / To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so? / I should’ve known," that led fans to believe the song is about Mayer. At the time of their relationship, Taylor Swift was only 19 while John Mayer was 32 years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Initially, the singer <a href=#>wasn't thrilled that Taylor Swift wrote a song about him</a>. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Mayer revealed: "It made me feel terrible because I didn’t deserve it. I’m pretty good at taking accountability now, and I never did anything to deserve that. It was a really lousy thing for her to do… I was really caught off guard, and it really humiliated me at a time when I’d already been dressed down. I mean, how would you feel if, at the lowest you’ve ever been, someone kicked you even lower?"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="‘All Too Well’: John Mayer Replies To Angry Swiftie Chosen At Random">‘All Too Well’: John Mayer Replies To Angry Swiftie Chosen At Random</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it seems as if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the singer's opinion on the song has changed since then</a>. In an interview with Andy Cohen, John Mayer revealed how he feels about the Taylor Swift song now. "Sometimes, I hope it’s about me. Sometimes, it’s a really good song. I don’t think it’s a dirty admission. Sometimes, a song is so good, I go, 'Man, I hope that’s about me.' … I’ll check everyone’s music out. I’m a fan," he said.</p><p>Two other songs from Speak Now that many believe to be about John Mayer as well are "The Story of Us" and "Superman."</p><h2 id=which-john-mayer-song-is-about-taylor-swift>Which John Mayer Song Is About Taylor Swift?</h2><p>John Mayer also used his experience with Taylor Swift to create music. Fans believe that his song "Paper Doll" from his 2013 album Paradise Valley<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is about the famous singer</a>. In particular, the lyrics "Paper doll, come try it on / Step out of that black chiffon / Here’s a dress of gold and blue / Sure was fun being good to you" are believed to be a direct reference to Taylor Swift's song "Dear John" in which she calls herself "the girl in the dress" who "cried the whole way home."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another part of "Paper Doll" that fans link to Taylor Swift is "You're like twenty-two girls in one/ And none of them know what they're runnin' from." Plenty believe that this part is a reference to both, Taylor Swift's hit single "22," and the lyric in "Dear John" which says "I'll look back and regret / How I ignored when they said / Run as fast as you can."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Was Taylor Swift And John Mayer's Relationships Really Like?">What Was Taylor Swift And John Mayer's Relationships Really Like?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source revealed to US Weekly that John Mayer</a> is "trying his best to avoid the attention he’s been getting from Taylor’s new album. He’s not going to make any public comments directly related to her songs or album." As fans of Taylor Swift know, the singer is currently in the process of re-recording her discography, and fans can't wait for Speak Now(Taylor's Version).</p><p>Even when Taylor's version of Red came out, John Mayer was warned by fans that when Speak Now comes out he will be in the spotlight again. The source for Us Weekly revealed that John Mayer feels like 2010 "is coming back to haunt him," adding that he has been through a lot, and he is "faced with the humiliation all over again." Judging from the size of Swift's fandom, Mayor won't have an easy time when Speak Now (Taylor's Version) comes out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Blackpink Fans Want Rosé To Cover ‘Dear John’ After John Mayer Gifted Her A Guitar">Blackpink Fans Want Rosé To Cover ‘Dear John’ After John Mayer Gifted Her A Guitar</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGTnXq0u82gqmacmZl6q7vHp2Smmamav26tzZ1krZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXay%2FqsDEZpibp6WpeqatwqFkqKyYmr9w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-nikki-bella-pictures-that-john-cena-has-lost-sleep-over.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Nikki Bella Pictures That John Cena Has Lost Sleep Over</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ivan-fandino-spain-france-death-bull-fight-last-words-live-leak-gored.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The demise of the Champion matador Ivan Fandino in a bullfight!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
