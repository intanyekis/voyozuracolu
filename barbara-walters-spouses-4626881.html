The sad news was confirmed by her longtime former employer <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC News</a> on Friday, Dec. 30 in an on-air tribute and statement online.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>She has interviewed an immeasurable number of celebrities including <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Donald Trump</a>, </strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tom Cruise </strong></a>and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Oprah Winfrey,</strong></a>&nbsp;and hosted shows like 20/20 and The Today Show. However, she was best known for creating and starring on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The View</a>.&nbsp;She launched the popular all-female daytime talk show in 1997. She lead firey debates on the series until she announced her retirement from television in 2014.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>As far as her personal life goes, the journalist and TV personality was married four times. However, she only had four husbands. While this may seem like on of those brain-teasing riddles, there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation. Here’s how Barbara Walters got married four times and everything you need to know about her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three husbands</a>.</p><h2>Robert Henry Katz</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>Robert Henry Katz</strong> was Barbara’s first husband. He has had a fulfilling life as a former Navy lieutenant and business executive. He and Barbara got married on June 20, 1955, at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Plaza Hotel</a> in New York City. She was just 26 years old at the time and her career in journalism hadn’t taken off yet. Unfortunately, their marriage didn’t last long. They filed for divorce in 1957 and had their marriage annulled in 1958.</p><h2>Lee Guber</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Barbara-Walters-Spouses-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>Lee Guber&nbsp;</strong>was Barbara’s second husband. Lee was also involved in the entertainment industry as a theatrical producer and theater owner. They wed on December 8, 1963, as Barbara was in the early stages of her journey at NBC’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Today Show</a>.&nbsp;A few years into their marriage, they explored the option of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>having children</a>. Unfortunately, they struggled to have a child on their own biologically which lead them down the path of adoption. When their friends who were looking to adopt a boy were offered a girl, Barbara and Lee jumped at the opportunity. They adopted&nbsp;<strong>Jacqueline Dena Guber&nbsp;</strong>when she was an infant in 1968. Barbara and Lee got divorced after 13 years of marriage in 1976 when their daughter was just eight years old.</p><h2>Merv Adelson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Barbara-Walters-Spouses-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>Merv Adelson </strong>is the lucky husband that got to marry Barbara not once but twice. The two met on a blind date that one could say went exceedingly well. Barbara got married to the CEO of Lorimar Television in 1981 as her career was booming and she was getting started on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>20/20</a>. The pair ended up divorcing in 1984, the year she landed the co-host spot on&nbsp;20/20 alongside Hugh Downs.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>They attempted to rekindle their relationship and even got married again in 1986. Unfortunately, the second time wasn’t a charm for them and they ended up splitting again in 1992. Barbara, however, didn’t hold their marriages not working out against him. “Merv was a kind and gentle man with a great sense of humor,” Barbara told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a>. “We stayed friends long after our marriage.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Merv was a big name in the entertainment industry aside from dating Barbara. He was known as the mogul behind hit shows like&nbsp;The Waltons&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dallas.&nbsp;However, his ventures weren’t limited to the entertainment industry. He branched out and invested in the idea of a “24-hour market” opening Market Town off the Vegas strip in 1953. He paired up with a man named Molasky to open the Las Vegas Country Club which was funded by mob boss Moe Dalitz. Merv and the rest of them were exposed in 1963’s “The Green Felt Jungle.” Merv insisted to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>&nbsp;in 2013.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GaqZuZopZ6uK3LrZyrq12ovbDB0p6qZmxmZ4N5hJBo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-is-steve-howeys-wifes-net-worth-after-their-divorce.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Is Steve Howeys Wifes Net Worth After Their Divorce?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cheryl-mcspadden-gary-mcspadden-sisterbio-wiki-age-husband-books-career-net-worth-3.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cheryl McSpadden ( GaryMcSpadden Sister)Bio, Wiki, Age, Husband, Books, Career, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
