The beginning of the video shows the Masked Singer host smoking and listening to the 47-year-old rapper’s old songs and interviews. Eminem’s 1993 song “Foolish Pride” is included on the playlist and features the lyrics, “Black girls are bitches, black girls are dumb.”</p><p>Eminem (real name Marshall Mathers) continues to rap on the track, “Blacks and whites, they sometimes mix / But black girls only want your money ‘cause they’re dumb chicks / Don’t date a black girl / If you do it once, you won’t do it twice / Black girls are dumb, and white girls are good chicks.”</p><p>Cannon addressed Eminem’s lyrics on his diss tracking rapping, “We let you be a guest in this house but now you cancelled, Slim. Had to put my motherf–king turban on / Outside your motherf—kin’ suburban home / Protesting with AKs and guns / Our queens don’t need your racism / You’re the KKK of this generation.”</p><p>The “Wild ‘n Out” host added, “I don’t give a damn if his a— was young /I can’t let that slide, that’s on my son.”</p><p>Eminem apologized for the lyrics on “Foolish Pride” in 2003 after the track leaked and explained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he penned the song out of anger </a>after breaking up with his girlfriend at the time.</p><p>“The tape … was something I made out of anger, stupidity and frustration when I was a teenager. I’d just broken up with my girlfriend, who was African American, and I reacted like the angry, stupid kid I was,” the Detroit native said. “I hope people will take it for the foolishness that it was, not for what somebody is trying to make it into today.”</p><p>The feud between the rappers was ignited after Eminem called Cannon’s ex-wife,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> Mariah Carey</strong></a>, “a nutjob” on <strong>Fat Joe</strong>‘s track “Lord Above,” which was released on December 6.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Nick-Cannon-Samples-Racist-Eminem-Lyrics-in-Third-Diss-Track.jpg><p>“Word to the Terror Squad, Joe, this is all puns aside though / I know me and Mariah didn’t end on a high note / But that other dude’s whipped, that p—y got him neutered / Tried to tell him this chick’s a nut job before he got his jewels clipped / Almost got my caboose kicked, fool, quit, you not gon’ do s–t / I let her chop my balls off, too ‘fore I lost to you, Nick,” Eminem rapped in reference to his rumoured romance with Carey, 49.</p><p>In response, Cannon took to Instagram on December 7 to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">invite “grandpa” Eminem </a>to a rap battle on his MTV Show, Wild ’n Out. The America’s Got Talent alum took another hit at Eminem on his radio show one day earlier.</p><p>“We should change his name from Eminem to, like, Percocet,” Cannon said on his Nick Cannon Mornings show. “What’s the pill old that people use? We are going to call him Cialis. Bring your walker, get out your wheelchair, Eminem, and pop whatever you want to pop.”</p><p>Cannon added more fuel to the fire when he blasted Eminem on his first diss track, “The Invitation,” on December 9, rapping “I heard your chauffeur got a video of you suckin’ a c–k.” The song also includes a voicemail from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Suge Knight</strong></a>, who calls Eminem “a bitch.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem responded via Twitter</a> writing, “U mad bro? Stop lying on my d–k. I never even had a chauffeur, you bougie f–ck.”He added, “I demand an apology Nicholas, you’ve made my gardener so jealous!”</p><p>The Drumline star released a second diss track titled “Pray for Him” on December 10 which referred to the “Stan” rapper as “the new white supremacist.”</p><p>Eminem’s longtime friend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>50 Cent</strong></a> supported his pal via Twitter and slammed<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Cannon’s “trash” diss track.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I don’t understand to save my life why someone would pick a fight with EM,” the “In Da Club” rapper tweeted on December 10. “He is a different kinda animal, I haven’t seen a motherf—ker come close to beating him man. hey Nick that s—t was trash, I oughta kick you in yo ass when I see you PUNK!”</p><p>Cannon and Carey were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married from 2008 to 2016</a> and are the parents of 8-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe. Eminem, for his part, has alluded to a romance with the “Always Be My Baby” hitmaker for years, which Carey has denied.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZOgeqStzaemp2WjlrqxuMSsZKuZk57AtXnEpqCnnZ1iubq%2ByJyqZqGeYoCzsIydoKyrXam%2Foq%2FKaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./peter-asher.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Peter Asher</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-savage-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Savage Net Worth - Pulptastic</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
