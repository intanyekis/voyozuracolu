I only knew of three,” Mauricio told his wife. Kyle hit back, saying, “Well maybe you should be looking at my body closer.”</p><p>The Agency founder said that she has “enough” tattoos. Kyle, however, revealed her plans to maybe “get another one.”</p><p>“Five tattoos is a lot,” Mauricio continued. “I will not allow that.”</p><p>Kyle responded, “You didn’t even know how many I had. … If I want one I’m going to get one. It’s my body.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mauricio-Umansky-Will-Not-Allow-Kyle-Richards-to-Get-Any-More-Tattoos-1.jpg><p>As Mauricio continued to dissuade her from getting any more ink designs, Kyle told her husband that he doesn’t “have a choice.”</p><p>“I’m at a point in my life where I don’t have to explain anything to anybody anymore. Including you” Kyle added. “I went from doing everything my mom told me to do to being a mom myself and having to be a good example to my girls and I just realized you can do all that and things can still go to s—t.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in July that Kyle and Mauricio had <a href=#>separated after 27 years of marriage</a>. That same month, the Bravo stars — who have been married since 1996 — have denied rumors that they’re getting a divorce but shared that they <a href=#>went through a “rough patch.”</a></p><p>Fans have speculated that one of Kyle’s tattoos, a heart on her wrist, is matching with country singer <a href=#><strong>Morgan Wade</strong></a>. Kyle also inked a “K” onto Morgan in the RHOBH trailer. <a href=#>Morgan and Kyle have both denied</a> that they’re anything more than friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mauricio-Umansky-Will-Not-Allow-Kyle-Richards-to-Get-Any-More-Tattoos-2.jpg><p>Mauricio told Us earlier this month that he and Kyle are <a href=#>still “working on” their relationship</a>.</p><p>“We’re in the middle of dealing with our life and our marriage and we have not thrown in the towel,” he told Us. “It’s hard in the public eye and it’s hard while everybody’s asking because the reality is that when a couple’s going through the times that we’re going through right now, what you need is time.”</p><p><a href=#>Their marriage struggles</a> will be chronicled on RHOBH season 13, which filmed earlier this year.</p><p>“Mau and I have had a challenging year together. He has been working nonstop, I’ve been working,” Kyle admitted in her confessional during Wednesday’s premiere. “When you have to schedule a meeting to go over your schedule, you know it’s a problem.”</p><p>Kyle went on to say that she’s going through a “painful” time in her life, in part, because she feels “disconnected” from Mauricio.</p><p>Kyle said the tattoo argument is “a big symptom of not spending time together” during her confessional. “Years ago he would have noticed a freckle on body and now he doesn’t know that I have two more tattoos.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During their argument Kyle said she doesn’t “have to answer to anybody” anymore.</p><p>“Listen, I am very f—king clear right now,” she told Mauricio. “I’m not rebelling, I’m just really clear.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKypJViv6qvx5qpnatdlrulecyarKuhk568bsHMmqWso6lis6qzx61kqK6Vp3q1rdOtpqirXae1sK7HZqmem5GlfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-winwood-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Winwood Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-is-jadyn-wongs-net-worth-know-about-her-bio-wiki-age-height-married-husband-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jadyn Wong's Net Worth, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Married, Husband, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
