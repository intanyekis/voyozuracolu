Not only did she go on to become a successful singer after winning American Idol&nbsp;in 2002, but she is now a household name and talk show host. The “Since U Been Gone” songstress began hosting <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>&nbsp;in 2019 and is very open about her personal life on the show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Most recently, Kelly admitted that “dating sucks” in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>&nbsp;in January 2024. She explained that she’s been thriving as a single woman. “I was single until I was, like, 30, and I forgot how really good at that I am,” she told the outlet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The TV personality opened up about her dating life and whether or not she is single (more on that below) during a December 2023 episode. Her recent comments on her dating life come just two years after Kelly ended her first and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>only marriage</a>. She even spoke to actress&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shannen Doherty</strong></a> about where she stands on dating post-divorce. Keep reading to learn about Kelly’s relationship status, her ex, and more!</p><h2>Is Kelly Clarkson Single?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The 41-year-old appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her talk show</a> on December 20, 2023, and confirmed that she is currently single. Kelly spoke to the Charmed alum and admitted that she not ready to jump back into the dating pool just yet. “I am still in the stage of really enjoying me, so I’m not there,” Kelly explained at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She also revealed that it “can be hard” to date and find love following <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a divorce</a>. “After divorce it can be hard,” the blonde beauty said. “After losing a relationship that you’d thought you’d spend forever with this person… that can be hard.” Later, Kelly talked about her pets and admitted that, for now, she prefers “dog love.”</p><h2>Who Was Kelly Clarkson Married to?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/is-kelly-clarkson-single-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Before Kelly was in her single era, she was married to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brandon Blackstock</strong></a>, 47, from 2013 until they divorced in 2021. The former lovebirds met the same year that they got married and later welcomed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two children</a> including <strong>River Rose</strong>, 9, and son <strong>Remington “Remy” Alexander</strong>, 7.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>After seven years of marriage, Kelly filed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>for divorce</a> from Brandon, as reported by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EW</a>. Following their split, Brandon was ordered to pay his ex $2.6 million in connection to payments he received as Kelly’s manager during their marriage, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. One year after their divorce, a source close to the duo told&nbsp;<strong>Hollywood Life&nbsp;</strong>that Kelly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wasn’t ready</a> to begin a new romance. “Kelly’s friends have been such a huge support system during her divorce from Brandon. All they want is for her to be happy,” they said at the time. “She is still adjusting to her new normal in life and a romantic relationship just isn’t on her radar at the moment.”</p><h2>What Kelly Clarkson Has Said About Dating</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Kelly revealed why she isn’t ready to start a new relationship during the same interview mentioned above. “I think too that there’s a lot to learn about yourself in a relationship and how you are in a relationship,” she said to Shannen. “I think I need a little more work on that end of it. I need a little more work on me in a relationship and how to make sure to take care of myself at the same time as somebody else.” The proud single mother also went on to joke that she enjoys being on her own. “Also, I love me and I love spending time with me,” Kelly said. “It’s really great. It feels powerful.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In the above-mentioned&nbsp;People&nbsp;interview, Kelly spoke about how “awkward” dating can be, and spoke about the things that she’s looking for in another partner. “told a friend [that a potential partner] would have to be an individual that brings their own life to the table without needing anything from me. It’s far more romantic to say, ‘I want you, but I don’t need anything,'” she said. “I’m really good right now, I’m having a good time.”</p><h2>Does Kelly Clarkson Plan on Getting Married Again?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Even though her divorce with Brandon is finalized, it doesn’t seem like Kelly has any plans to rush down the aisle again any time soon. “[Brandon] had children, a religious background, and it was important, I think, for him. But I’ve never been that person. Because I’ve been through a couple divorces in my family, I just don’t like to put any weight on it. It can happen; it doesn’t have to happen. For my kids, I definitely would never even think about it until they’re out of my house,” she told&nbsp;People.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8isZKSdnKHGbq%2FLmqmkq5%2BjerS1zaCjnmVlZ350g49qZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kaley-cuoco-admitted-appearing-on-the-big-bang-theory-was-a-nightmare-for-even-the-most-established-stars.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kaley Cuoco Admitted Appearing On The Big Bang Theory Was A Nightmare For Even The Most Established</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eleceed-chapter-255-release-date-spoilers-where-to-read.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eleceed Chapter 255: Release Date, Spoilers &amp;amp; Where to Read</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
