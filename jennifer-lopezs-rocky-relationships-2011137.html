The Shades of Blue actress has been married three times and, in between, dated some of Hollywood’s biggest names, including<a href=#><strong> Ben Affleck</strong></a>.</p><p>The Second Act star kept it real about her <a href=#>quest to find everlasting love</a> while speaking with Harper’s Bazaar in January 2019. “For me, the relationship journey has been very up and down. But it didn’t have to do with anybody else but me — it was about me figuring out me. Until you learn to love yourself, you can’t completely love [someone else] in a way that is pure and true. Once you do that, you can have relationships that are based on love and respect, that are supportive and nourishing,” Lopez said. “There’s an evolution there that had to happen for me. I feel like I’m in a better place now.”</p><p>Lopez was previously married to <strong>Ojani Noa</strong> from 1997 to 1998, <a href=#><strong>Cris Judd</strong></a> from 2001 to 2003 and <a href=#><strong>Marc Anthony</strong></a> — with whom she shares twins Max and Emme — from 2004 to 2014. She was also engaged to Affleck from 2002 to 2004 and got engaged to <a href=#><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a> in 2019. Us Weekly confirmed in March 2021 that Lopez and Rodriguez were “working through some things” amid reports that they split and called off their two-year engagement.</p><p>Despite her history of divorce, the songstress revealed to Harper’s Bazaar in March 2018 that she had not given up on the possibility of finding forever love. “I do <a href=#>believe in marriage</a>,” she said at the time. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.” She accepted Rodriguez’s proposal the following year.</p><p>Lopez noted in January 2021 that part of her journey toward getting to know herself involved reflecting on her past romances. “I remember when I was going through therapy at the beginning, you know, kind of in my late 30s and there was a lot of talk about loving yourself and I was like, ‘I <a href=#>love myself</a>,’” she recalled on Coach Conversations. “But obviously, I was doing all these things in, like, my personal relationships that didn’t seem like I was loving myself, but I didn’t even understand the concept of it. It took time and it’s a journey and it’s still a journey for me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She and Rodriguez went on to confirm their split in April 2021 after months of speculation. She then rekindled a romance with Affleck and the singer <a href=#>announced their engagement — for the second time</a> — nearly two decades after their initial split.</p><p>Scroll through the photos below to relive Lopez’s dating history — from her marriages to her engagements and more!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a6zaKdnqpdobyxsdmsZKunk6DGbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z6xka2hhZn50g44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-stapleton-kprc2-bio-wiki-age-height-family-wife-salary-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Stapleton KPRC2, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Wife, Salary and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jack-ciattarelli-net-worth-policies-parents-pension-plan-education-voting-record-campaign-manager.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jack Ciattarelli Net Worth, Policies, Parents, Pension Plan, Education, Voting Record, Campaign Mana</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
