But with gatherings in Los Angeles and many parts of California still limited to 10 people or less due to COVID-19, she’s had bail on her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>epic party extravaganza,</a> as well as the outfit that she had been dreaming up for the occasion. The KKW Beauty founder tells <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grazia</a> magazine that “I had the best plan. It was going to be called Wild, Wild Miss West’s 40th Birthday. I had <strong>Manfred Thierry Mugler</strong> make me a metal costume. Like, a cowgirl costume.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>The 39-year-old fashion lover and the man who designed her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>controversial 2019 Met Gala look</a> had been working for months on her outfit. Kim says she does plan to wear it sometime in the future to see and be seen with the full big-bang affect. “I have it and it is insane. We did virtual fittings. I don’t even want to waste it on a party for myself with five people. I want it to be something. So, I’m thinking maybe next year. I can have it on my 41st. We can still call it my 40th, right?” she told the publication.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kim-kardashian-insane-birthday-outfit-ap-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>If past collaborations are any indication, this outfit will be one to remember. Mugler is responsible for some of Kim’s most mind-blowing — and eyebrow raising — looks over the past several years. Her most memorable was when she attended the May 6, 2019 Met Gala looking as if she has just emerged in the buff from the ocean, covered in dripping crystals that looked like water. Her nude, skin-tight shiny dress matched the colored of her spray tan, and Kim’s waist was cinched <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to appear impossibly tiny</a> thanks to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a custom made corset</a> by couturier <strong>Mister Pearl</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“This is the first time in 20 years Mr. Mugler has designed for the House of Mugler,” she told Vogue at the time about her amazing dress “So to come and design this gown for me is such an honor. This is about eight months in the making. He envisioned me this California girl stepping out of the ocean, wet, dripping.” Even Kim’s hair was styled to have a wet look and waves as if she emerged from the water.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kim-kardashian-insane-birthday-outfit-ap-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Mugler also designed Kim’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>breast-baring black gown</a> for the fifth annual Hollywood Beauty Awards on Feb. 17, 2019. The top featured two slim pieces of fabric that stretched across Kim’s bare bosom. It was a wardrobe malfunction waiting to happen, if not for the reality star’s noted love of double sided tape. On Sept. 2, 2020, Kim gave her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> followers a Mugler fashion show in photos wearing some of her favorite designs by the design legend.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>As for turning 40, Kim is okay with the number, especially after losing her dad <strong>Robert Kardashian Sr.</strong> in 2003, aged 59. “I’m not one that gets nervous about getting older. I obviously do what I can to try and feel as youthful or to look a certain way. But I’m proud that my kids get me here another year. I always think about that. Particularly losing your dad or a parent or someone close to you at a young age,” she tells the publication. From the sound of it, Kim’s small 40th birthday celebration&nbsp; is going to just include those nearest and dearest, including husband <strong>Kanye West</strong>, 43,&nbsp; and their beloved four children <strong>North</strong>, 7, <strong>Saint</strong>, 4, <strong>Chicago</strong>, 2, and <strong>Psalm</strong>, 1. Maybe next year fans will get to see her metal cowgirl costume.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe49uZqShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjenV806Fkm6GiqbWlrdhmpq6slp7BbrnUoKOeql2isrWty2aaqK%2BXnr%2BtecKoqq2tnZp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./roy-keane-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Roy Keane Net Worth, Wife, Parents, Age, Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bilal-coulibaly-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bilal Coulibaly Net Worth How Much is Bilal Coulibaly Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
