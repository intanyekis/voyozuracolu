University's Law School Bar Association President after they apparently sent an incendiary pro-Hamas message to the school.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Megyn Kelly accuses Gavin Newsom of using ‘middle school debate tactics’ during Fox News face-off with Ron DeSantis</a></p><p>Ryna Workman supposedly sent a weekly newsletter on Tuesday, October 10, saying that Israel "bears full responsibility" for the murders of innocent children, women, and citizens during Hamas’ brutal attack.</p><p>The 24-year-old, who hails from Simpsonville, South Carolina, also refused to condemn the militant organization that launched a barrage of 2000 missiles and proceeded with ground attacks on October 7.</p><p>Israeli officials previously confirmed that at least 900 Israelis had been killed in the attack while another 2,600 were gravely injured.&nbsp;</p><p>In retaliation, the government has also begun bombarding Gaza after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the IDF would "use all its force to destroy Hamas's capabilities" and to take "mighty vengeance for this black day."&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>'You are a star': Fans hail Megyn Kelly as she reveals

goes by pronouns they/them, wrote,&nbsp;"I want to express, first and foremost, my unwavering and absolute solidarity with Palestinians in their resistance against oppression towards liberation and self-determination."&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Megyn Kelly fangirls over Barbra Streisand as she shares reason for listening to actress' memoir audiobook</a></p><p>"Israel bears full responsibility for this tremendous loss of life. This regime of state-sanctioned violence created the conditions that made resistance necessary," continued the NYU student, who has worked as a summer associate for two years at Winston & Strawn, as per the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Post.</a></p><p>They added, "I will not condemn Palestinian resistance," and instead wrote about the "violence of… apartheid, military occupation, the United States military industrial complex and obfuscating genocide as a 'complex issue'," among other things.</p><p>Before attending NYU, Workman finished their undergraduate studies at the University of South Carolina and also participated in an exchange program at the University of Warwick in the UK, where they attended international law courses.</p><h2 class=split>Ryna Workman was fired over the apparent pro-Hamas email</h2><p>A few hours after Ryna Workman’s message was publicized, the law firm of Winston & Strawn announced that their offer of employment to the NYU student had been withdrawn.</p><p>"Today, Winston & Strawn learned that a former summer associate published certain inflammatory comments regarding Hamas’ recent terrorist attack on Israel and distributed it to the NYU Student Bar Association," read the firm's statement, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail.</a></p><p>It continued, "These comments profoundly conflict with Winston & Strawn’s values as a firm. Accordingly, the Firm has rescinded the law student’s offer of employment."&nbsp;</p><p>The university also told Daily Mail that Workman’s statement "does not in any way reflect the point of view of NYU."&nbsp;</p><p>"Acts of terrorism are immoral. The indiscriminate killing of civilians and hostage-taking, including children and the elderly, is reprehensible. Blaming victims of terrorism for their own deaths is wrong," said NYU spokesman John Beckman.</p><h2 class=split>Megyn Kelly leads condemnation of Ryna Workman</h2><p>Megyn Kelly took to X (formerly Twitter) to reflect on Ryna Workman’s apparently pro-Hamas newsletter, writing, "Whereupon Ryna Workman, President of the NYU Student Bar Ass’n, had her job offer withdrawn thanks to her disgusting antisemitism and to @WinstonLaw’s moral code & backbone. Good for them."</p><p>The former Fox News host added, "Maybe Ryna can get a job on the UN Human Rights Council."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Whereupon Ryna Workman, President of the NYU Student Bar Ass’n, had her job offer withdrawn thanks to her disgusting antisemitism and to <a href=#>@WinstonLaw</a>’s moral code & backbone.
