Although it hasn’t been officially confirmed by police, the Canadian rapper’s brother, <strong>Pete Stay</strong>, confirmed the death, which took place Sunday morning, to CBC, the outlet further reported. Authorities apparently responded to the shocking incident just after midnight and Pat died from his injuries shortly after being transported to a hospital. As of Sept. 4, there’s reportedly still been no arrest for the stabbing and authorities are asking anyone with information to come forward. A GoFundMe has been organized for his family <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>As we send our comfort to Pat’s family, friends, and fans, find out more about him and his budding rap career below.</p><h2>Pat was known for being one of the best battle rappers on the scene.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>The rapper, who was from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, would <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>often battle</a> other rappers on stages by using freestyle, insults, and wordplay, and became popular among the community. Despite his success, he still admitted to not having big connections that could help him get on “big media outlets/platforms” and just hours before his death, he asked for his followers’ help with getting more exposure on his Instagram story.</p><h2>His success brought on a fairly large social media following.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>At the time of his death, Pat had over 70,000 followers on Instagram and over 43,000 followers on Twitter.

He would sometimes share photos and sweet messages to them on social media for special occasions, like their birthdays. Last week, on Calvin’s birthday, the doting dad shared photos of him, including one in which he was holding him close, alongside a loving caption.</p><p class=_a9zs><span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">“Today is my best friends 5th birthday. My real life super hero, Calvin Royce Stay. I really mean it when I say I can never find the words to truly describe how much I love you buddy,” he wrote. “I adore you, I admire you, you’re a child yet I still look up to you. You are everything I could have ever dreamed of in a son x1000. I am constantly in disbelief with how lucky I am and how special you are. I shed happy tears thinking about it and our special bond, often. I’m sure I’ll be posting more videos and pics in my story today but for now.
