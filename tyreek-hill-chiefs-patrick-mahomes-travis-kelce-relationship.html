"I was hurt, bruh. I was hurt. Patrick, you ain't never invite me over to your house like you did Kelce. You always invited Kelce. That's why we here where we at now."</p><p>Hill also went on to describe himself as the “main chick” as it pertained to his role in teams before, saying that he wasn't keen on a “side chick” role in Kansas City.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE NFL">READ MORE NFL</h2><p>"I never been anybody's side chick before," Hill said. "Never. Always, my whole life - high school, middle school - all the quarterbacks, (I was their) main chick. Always. I go to K.C., now I'm the side chick."</p><p>Hill obviously felt slighted playing second fiddle to Kelce both on and off the field.&nbsp;</p><p>The wideout topped over 1,100 receiving yards in four of his six seasons with the Chiefs and clearly felt frustrated at his limited role in Andy Reid's offense.</p><p>Speaking of Reid, Hill also said he had some "dicey" conversations with the Chiefs head coach, as well as Mahomes, before he left for Miami.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in NFL</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/12/tyreek2.png><p>He said Mahomes and Reid were the last people he talked to before he was traded.</p><p>"Those conversations were kind of dicey," the wide receiver said. "So here we are today."</p><p>The 7x Pro Bowler also spoke about the Dolphins' Week 9 matchup with the Chiefs in Germany, which his former team won, 21-14.</p><p>Hill said that he didn't feel the same kind of love bumping into Mahomes and Reid as he did with other former teammates such as Kelce.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Denver Broncos celebrate stopping Patrick Mahomes making history by trolling Travis Kelce by playing Taylor Swift song</span><p>"I felt great," he said. "You can ask anybody - I'm the kinda person, I don't give a f***, I'm gonna tell you how I feel. If I f*** with you, I f*** with you. If you don't f*** with me, that's cool. You do your thing. I know how I feel about you though. I understand that you may feel some kind of way because of how things played out. I ain't got no control about how you feel…. After the game though, Pat came up to me…"</p><p>The Chiefs ultimately ended up winning the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> last season without Hill, but may be regretting the trade this season as their receiver group continues to struggle.</p><p>Hill, meanwhile, leads the NFL with 1,324 receiving yards and 10 touchdown catches this season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraGlma352hZFoq7KqlZq4brTIpaNmm5iesqe%2FjKmYraqZmLhuucChpqado2LBs63Voqpmo5WhsKZ50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bill-oreilly-net-worth-career-married-divorce-children-wiki-bio.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bill O'Reilly's Net Worth, Career, Married, Divorce, Children, Wiki-Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wwes-triple-h-pays-tribute-to-late-ex-girlfriend-chyna-w203630.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>WWEs Triple H Pays Tribute to Late Ex-Girlfriend Chyna</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
