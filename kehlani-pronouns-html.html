But it looks like Kehlani’s had enough because <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she tweeted her response</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She also took to her Instagram stories to criticize all the blogs and magazines for the “click bait” stories.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Kehlani’s Coming Out&nbsp;</h2><p>During the Byrdie interview, Kehlani also talked about her coming out.</p><p>Earlier this year, Kehlani <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">came out as a lesbian</a> on TikTok and Instagram Live. According to the ‘Can I’ hitmaker, her friends and family were already aware that she was one and was waiting for her to realize it.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m like, Guys, I finally know that I’m gay — like, I’m&nbsp;gay&nbsp;gay, and they’re like, We know.
