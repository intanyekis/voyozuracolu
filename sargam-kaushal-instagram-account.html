But the driving force, the root of it all, is this man—my father. He's always told me, "You're different, I see it in your eyes," since I was a tiny child. You were born to achieve higher things in life. Things that individuals want to do but lack the confidence to accomplish. Even as a child, you had courage in your heart and fire in your gut."</p><p>"I never thought I'd be able to live up to these statements until I won Mrs. India World this year. Dad stated, "I'm not surprised," during one of my interviews. This was her fate. And there will be more. So there you have it. This daughter is only following through on a commitment she unintentionally made to her father. That is her reasoning. Sargam Kaushal previously won the Mrs. India World 2022 beauty pageant, held in Mumbai in June of this year, and therefore qualified to represent the country in the Mrs. World competition."</p><p>India has only won this championship once. In 2001, Dr. Aditi Govitrikar won the championship and returned the crown to India. She previously held the title of Gladrags Mrs. India 2001. Dr. Govitrikar, along with Soha Ali Khan & Mohammad Azharuddin, sat as a judge for Mrs. India Inc 2022-23.</p><h3><strong>FAQs&nbsp; about Sargam Kaushal</strong></h3><p><strong>Q.
