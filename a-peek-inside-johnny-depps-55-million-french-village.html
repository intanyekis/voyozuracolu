Depp first listed the property for in 2015 and 2016 with the price wavering from $25 million to $63 million. He just relisted it again last year for $55 million. Depp’s French Village has more than a dozen buildings and when it was first listed on June 2015 with the Côte d’Azur Sotheby’s International Realty, it was priced roughly around $26 million. The initial listing was taken off the market just after a few months. It was then listed yet again but with Michaël Zingraf of France-based Michaël Zingraf Real Estate and Rick Hilton of Hilton & Hyland. Both of the firms mentioned are exclusive affiliates of the Christie’s International Real Estate. Depp has <a href=#>sold about eight art works</a> by the artist Jean-Michel Basquiatt through the Christie’s International Real Estate which gave him a total of $14.6 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pirates of the Caribbean actor believes that the first listing was way below its appropriate price and it was Depp who decided to list the property for $55 million. According to Depp, the property is most ideal for the buyers who are seeking privacy. Several billionaires have already inquired about the property however to this day, the property remains to be in the hands of Depp.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside Johnny Depp's Extensive Property Portfolio</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SD Entertainer</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robb Report</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WSJ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaaZaCasqx5yKeqopyVYrewtM2nsGaclaW9tHmUbmSmoZyhtrC6jJ%2BpnqaTnXq3tculmKCdXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aubree-trainer-missing-or-spending-time-off-the-grid-willingly.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aubree Trainer Missing Or Spending Time Off The Grid Willingly?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./20-gimmicks-and-storylines-the-wwe-was-forced-to-drop.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>20 Gimmicks And Storylines The WWE Was Forced To Drop</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
