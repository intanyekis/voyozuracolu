The pairs got into fights more often than once and broke up on more than one occasion. But what makes the couple special is that no matter how many times they broke up, both Carin and Mark found their way back to each other. While Carin is a beautician, her husband Mark is an American singer who is the lead vocalist of the rock band Sugar Ray. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Carin Kingsland.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Upbringing & Early Career</h2><p>Carin Kingsland was born on the 15th of October 1973 in California, USA. Carin, who comes from Mexican descent, was raised in Rancho Cucamonga which is close to the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Carin was interested in cosmetics from a young age and was involved with the Cosmetology Career Center, during her high school years. After graduating from high school, Carin enrolled in the beautician course and received her license. Carin later moved to Los Angeles in search of better opportunities and started working as a professional beautician in her neighborhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/website-69.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meeting Mark and Marriage</h2><p>Carin and Mark first met at The Viper Room in 1994. Thinking about the time the pair first met, Mike, revealed that he said, ‘I Love You’ to Carin without even getting to know her. The pair began dating soon after and faced a series of hardships during the early years of the relationship. However, both Mark and Carin persevered and went on to date for 18 years before tying the knot. They walked down the aisle in a private wedding ceremony on September 24, 2012, in Southern California attended by their close friends and family. Mark revealed the news to People Magazine following the marriage, recounting all the moments of happiness and despair the pair spent together.</p><p>“After 18 years of breakups, makeups, beautiful twins and an unwavering love that provided some pretty damn good song lyrics, we are happy to announce that we are finally married.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Loving Wife and Mother</h2><p>Carin has twins with Mark and the pair are absolutely in love with their kids. Lydon and Harley were born in 2010, just four months into the pair’s engagement. As the pair struggled to get pregnant during their early years, Mark opened up that the pair had to depend on IVF.</p><p>“I tried my hardest the conventional way, but that didn’t work out for us. We did the IVF thing. It was intense and expensive, but we did it in one shot and, boom, here they are. My job now is to be the best parent I can be because that is all that matters.”</p><p>While Mark mentioned that he had a lot to learn about parenting, he was full of praise for Carin who was already the perfect mother. Following the announcement of the news, Mark gave an interview to Daily News saying how his kids would be the luckiest in the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life After Kids</h2><p>Following her marriage, Carin gave up on her career as a beautician and focused on raising children. And while not occupied with children, both Carin and Mark find some time to go on dates. They also appeared on some television shows such as Celebrity Wife Swap and Celebrity Big Brother. Talking about their marriage, Carin told The Agency,</p><p>“Without the kids, we like to go catch a movie at the ArcLight. They have adult theaters there so I can have a glass of wine and unwind! Mark and I tend to do more day dates. We love lunching together and shopping. We love the original Katsu-ya on the corner of Colfax and Ventura.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Quick Write on her Husband-Mark McGrath</h2><p>Mark McGrath is a versatile and talented American singer, composer and television host.
