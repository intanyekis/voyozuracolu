Furthermore, fans will also get to see her face KiLynn King in one-on-one action at Spring Slugfest when it airs. The match was pre-taped on April 29th. It is good to see Fatu back in the ring after being out of action for so long following her and Mercedes Moné’s departure from WWE. Impact Wrestling is a great fit for Fatu, which is something she believes as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/trinity-impact-debut-promo.jpeg><h2 id=impact-wrestling-can-succeed-where-wwe-failed-trinity-fatu>Impact Wrestling Can Succeed Where WWE Failed Trinity Fatu</h2><p>Fatu’s arrival in Impact Wrestling is a big deal. For months, she was one of the biggest free agents in professional wrestling. Fans had speculated where it could be that she would end up. Various companies floated around, with some even believing that she would go back to WWE. However, she ultimately chose Impact Wrestling. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking on her departure from WWE with NBC 5 Chicago</a>, she said, "I feel like it was a blessing in disguise. I feel that it's allowed me to grow and become better in every way, in every aspect. Show me how strong I really am.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>NJPW Almost Signed WWE's Naomi But Decided Against It To Save Money</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Fatu was a part of WWE, she was a consistent fan favorite. People wanted to see her get to the top of the card. While she did have a number of different accolades with the company, such as being SmackDown Women’s Champion and a Women’s Tag Team Champion, she was never given very strong and consistent booking. Fans made it known at various points that they disapproved of WWE’s booking of her, such as <a href=#>#NaomiDeservesBetter</a> in 2020. However, this never happened. After their rightful criticisms of their booking, Fatu and Moné left.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Naomi's WWE Career Is Full Of Wasted Potential</a></span></p><p>Impact Wrestling has a major opportunity with Fatu now being signed to them.
