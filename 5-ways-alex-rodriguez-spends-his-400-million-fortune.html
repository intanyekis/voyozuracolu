He is the highest-paid MLB player of all time, with the highest salary in 2013 when he earned $28 million for one season. After his retirement in 2016, Rodriguez reinvented himself through his fashion and purchases to create a new identity. <a href=#>He stepped into the world of business ventures</a> to earn profit from his earnings. The former shortstop is the owner of A-Rod Corp, an investment firm, and the Chairman of Presidente, a beer company. He has amassed a $400 million fortune and loves to spend his money on buying the best.</p><p>Rodriguez is known for his highly publicized relationship with singer Jennifer Lopez and the lavish spendings he made via real estate, watches, and the most expensive cars. Let’s take a look at how Alex Rodriguez spends his $400 million net worth.</p><h2 id=real-estate>Real Estate</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rodriguez loves living in luxury and large properties. The former baseball star had purchased a Miami waterfront property in 2020 with Jennifer Lopez costing $32 million. It had an area of 15,000 sq. ft located on a 40,000 sq. ft. of land on an artificial island. Additionally, he owns a Condo on Park Avenue with three bedrooms and four bathrooms. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Richest</a>, his Coral Gables Home is built on a 1.46 acre of land and costs $2.69 million, which features multiple swimming pools and even a basketball court.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Check Out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's Insane Collection Of Homes</a></span></p><h2 id=luxury-superyachts-and-a-private-jet>Luxury Superyachts And A Private Jet</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Rodriguez was new to his <a href=#>single life after the break-up</a>, he decided to celebrate in style. He was photographed soaking the sun in St. Tropez in the South Of France on a 180-feet superyacht called the Ocean Paradise. The cost of the yacht is $32 million, and the weekly charter rate is $312,000.</p><p>As for his aviation journeys, A-Rod owns a Gulfstream VI SF that he purchased in 2017 by splashing out a whopping $4.2 million, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emirates 247</a>. The jet features a seating area for ten people, Wifi, fine dining, and high-tech surround sound systems. He is known to spend over 500 hours chartering his jet to travel around.</p><h2 id=an-epic-car-collection>An Epic Car Collection</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A-Rod is a <a href=#>car enthusiast and has been spotted driving around only the best</a>. He owns a Rolls Royce Ghost, a stylish car that emits a 24-hour glow and comes with a 6.75-liter turbocharged V12 engine. The car has a starting price of $337,000. His lineup also contains the BMW 3-series, which were produced between 2011 and 2019. Rodriguez has also been spotted driving around in the Mercedes Maybach 57 S that comes with an option between the five-speed automatic transmission and manual mode.</p><p>His recent pricey purchase was a red Porsche 911 GT3 which he bought JLO for her birthday in 2020. After the split, the baseball star has reportedly kept the vehicle since he posted a photo of himself in front of the car. The Porsche set him back by over $100,000.</p><h2 id=expensive-watches-and-jewelry>Expensive Watches And Jewelry</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The biggest factor in <a href=#>Rodriguez’s transformation process</a> came from the noteworthy watch collection he purchased. A-Rod has a massive watch collection and only the best timepieces in his closet. He has been spotted wearing Rolex GMT-Master II, a Rolex Cosmograph Daytona in Platinum that costs upwards of $100,000. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiss Watch Expo</a>, the retired baseball player also owns Patek Phillipe Aquanaut, Rolex President Day-Date, and Cartier Santos 100 XL, collectively costing thousands of dollars.</p><p>Rodriguez also owns a good portion of jewelry, and one of his priciest purchases was the $1.8 million engagement ring he bought for Jennifer Lopez in 2019. The 15-carat customized ring was the talk of the town after the engagement was announced publicly.</p><h2 id=fine-art>Fine Art</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with his epic car collection and sprawling properties, not many people know that A-Rod is a serious art collector. He has spent millions of dollars collecting art to decorate his beautiful homes. One of his favorite artists is Jean-Michel Basquiat, whose 1984 painting titled M.T has a grand spot at the entrance of his Florida home. The other collectible art is Self-Portrait in Mirror #1 (Raina), made in 2012 by Jonathan Horowitz, a New York-based artist, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>.</p><p>He has also adorned his daughters Ella and Natasha’s rooms with fine art collectibles like Nate Lowman’s heart-shaped canvas in blue. His favorite artist is Andy Warhol, and he owns several pieces of the artist’s work. Rodriguez had plans to sell a major chunk of his collection for over $6 million to have a joint art collection <a href=#>with Jennifer Lopez</a>. However, he didn’t end up selling the work because of the split.</p><p>Alex Rodriguez has expensive tastes, and he treats himself to the best luxuries $400 million can buy. His spendings have ranged from the best car collections and jewelry to the most sought-after fine arts that adorn his homes. With his investment corporation finding momentum, his rising fortune&nbsp;may give rise to some more expensive purchases.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Tennis Legend Rafael Nadal Spends His $200 Million Fortune</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Richest</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emirates 247</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiss Watch Expo</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSCbsPAsqpmmZyaxW6%2Bzp2pop%2Blmsduv8%2BepZ2rXZ22tHmTaWdmpZmhuaq7zWadqKqkqrumew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-pettyfer-shows-off-his-raunchy-tattoos-2011284.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Pettyfer Shows Off His Raunchy Tattoos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stone-roses-bassist-pete-garner-wikipedia-and-age-death-and-cause.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stone Roses Bassist Pete Garner Wikipedia And Age: Death And Cause</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
