Berner started her very own podcast, Berning In Hell, which has become quite a popular show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her fame and success only skyrocketed when it was announced that she would be joining the cast of Summer House in its third season. While Hannah was definitely a ticking time bomb throughout the series, it appears as if things came to an explosive end for Berner following season 5.</p><p>After enduring one of the rockiest summers yet, Hannah found herself in the hot seat for most of the season, going up to bat against Lindsay Hubbard, Luke Gulbranson, Amanda Batula, Carl Radke, and Kyle Cooke, and that's just in her final season.</p><p>Hannah became the main target during the season reunion, leaving fans exhausted over the fact that she could not take accountability for any of her wrongdoings.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who Is Hannah Berner’s Fiancé Des Bishop, And What Does He Do For A Living?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Viewers called out Hannah for her hypocrisy, inability to apologize or take responsibility for her actions last summer, which ultimately landed her on the outs with her now, former houseguests.</p><p>While her less than stellar season was one reason for Hannah's departure from the show, it seems as if there is far more to her leaving than fans think. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, Hannah's departure also stemmed from people calling her out on allegedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stealing jokes from other comedians.</a></p><p>The star has also gone onto her podcast and made questionable comments about mental health and many accusations against her former co-stars, including the time she claimed Carl Radke had a drug problem, which he called her out on during the season 5 reunion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were quick to check Hannah for evolving into a not-so-great individual, despite her personality making great TV.</p><p>Luckily for Hannah, she has a great support system in her new soon-to-be husband, Des Bishop. The duo announced their engagement earlier this year after knowing one another for less than a year.</p><p>Des made an appearance on Summer House this season, and fans concluded that he and Hannah are practically the same person, hence why things worked out between the two.</p><p>Despite her departure from the show,&nbsp;it appears as if we'll be getting out favorites back for season 6, however, till then, fans can mark their calendar for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Summer House and Southern Charm mashup</a>, Summer House: Winter Charmn, which is set to air later this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who Is ‘Summer House’ Newbie Ciara Miller, And How Much Is She Worth?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KiuIyrnJqrn6N6uLTYZp%2Bapp6WtW6uxKulnqpdobKnwIysrKallad6qbvUrJxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-missy-peregrym-where-is-she-on-fbi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To Missy Peregrym, Where Is She On FBI?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-10-best-fat-guys-in-mma-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 Best &amp;quot;Fat Guys&amp;quot; in MMA History</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
