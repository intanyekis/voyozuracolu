I was a new mom. I didn’t know what I was going to use and what I wasn’t. So this time a little more educated.”</p><p>The former soccer player welcomed daughter Sterling with the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, 27, in February 2021. She’s <a href=#>expecting a baby boy</a> later this year.</p><p>“I did pack some burp cloths. I packed a swaddle for him. I use the SwaddleMe velcro swaddles. I think they’re the best,” Matthews explained before showing two types of lotion. “Aquaphor — normal Aquaphor and then I have some diaper cream.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Patrick-Mahomes-Pregnant-Wife-Brittany-Matthews-Details-Her-Hospital-Bags-01.jpg><p>The expecting mother added that she brings her own pacifiers, baby blanket, diapers and wipes, even though hospitals typically provide those. “I do bring the Boppy [pillow] and then just something to lay him on when he’s away, so I’m bringing the DockATot.</p><p>The Texas native also packed the Hatch Rest Baby Sound Machine and three Kyte onesies, including black and white ones with celestial patterns.</p><p>Matthews couldn’t show fans her name plate since she and Mahomes haven’t revealed what Sterling’s little brother will be called yet.</p><p>For her own hospital bag, comfort is key. The Kansas City Current owner uses the postpartum mom kit from Frida. “I still like to bring my own peribottle and underwear or the diaper stuff and all of that,” she explained. “But most importantly, I love the socks and I like the gown. I like to wear this [gown] instead of the one that the hospital gives you. This one is way more comfortable. It has buttons on the front of it and the back of it and it’s just bomb. I delivered Sterling in this last time and I highly, highly recommend.”</p><p>She added thick socks and slippers to her hospital bag as well. “You don’t really want to put pants on immediately after so I just recommend some nightgowns. Nursing bras for sure,” Matthews explained, noting that she bought a selection just in case of leaks.</p><p>She packed some rubber slides for shower shoes and a cozy robe. In addition to standard toiletries, the personal trainer has a hair dryer and straightener in her bag. She also shared that extra long phone charging cords are helpful and a surge protector with extra outlets helps make sure dad and grandma can stay plugged in too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Patrick-Mahomes-Pregnant-Wife-Brittany-Matthews-Details-Her-Hospital-Bags-Inline.jpg><p>“You need your going home outfits, which I recommend just some, like, loose pants. So I brought a few joggers and a sweatshirt and some comfy shoes to go home in,” she continued.</p><p>Her most interesting recommendation was blue Jolly Ranchers. “This is a weird thing but hard candy,” she admitted. “Obviously, once you start labor you cannot eat, so I needed something in my mouth to keep my mind off of food. Jolly Ranchers was that for me. I only like the blue ones.”</p><p>She captioned the clip, “Cause I was hangry let me tell ya 😂.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Matthews added that she felt much more prepared to deliver her baby boy since she’s done this before. “I felt like last time I overpacked and I just packed all this stuff that I didn’t even use and was very unnecessary so these are the crucial things for me,” she said.</p><p>The fitness influencer <a href=#>announced her pregnancy</a> in May, two months after <a href=#>tying the knot</a> with the NFL star. Mahomes and Matthews <a href=#>started dating in high school</a> and got engaged in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapmaSntqS3jKaYoaedmsBuvNGenqeZnql6uLXFnmSbqpmpwaK62GanmpubqHqpu9KpoK2ZnGKvorPSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sophie-winkleman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sophie Winkleman Married, Husband, Children, Wedding Date &amp;amp; Venue and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marlow-barkley-wikipedia-biography-age-wiki-height-parents-birthday.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marlow Barkley Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Parents, Birthday</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
