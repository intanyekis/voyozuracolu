And all that came down to was a result of me just trying to get the interview done quicker. I was like, ‘Next question. Next question.’ And then they just give me questions and I’m messing around.</p><p>“I think 2Pac is a legend. I don’t have to explain myself to anybody, but I grew up on a lot of old school West Coast, a lot of old school East Coast. But after that, that was just a little mishap. It was the result of me not being as mature as I am today. Inexperienced with interviews a lot, too.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He continued: “If you would ask me if I could go back and rewrite that, I wouldn’t though. Because it started an interesting conversation in Hip Hop. I did get a lot of backlash, of course, but as the years have gone by since that moment, it started what I think is a very good conversation in Hip Hop.</p><p>“Why do these new cats in Hip Hop that weren’t even born when someone like 2Pac was around, why do they have to idolize them like the older people? They can appreciate the craft and the music. It’s good. It’s amazing. It’s better than good. But if you think about it like that, that’s some hating stuff right there.”</p><p></p><p>Lil Xan’s controversial comments came during an interview with REVOLT in March 2018, and caused an uproar in the Hip Hop community, with <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Waka Flocka Flame going so far as to say that Xan should be banned from the genre altogether</a>.</p><p>“People are allowed to not like 2Pac’s music, tbh there is a lot that is NOT great,” Hot 97’s Ebro Darden added on Twitter at the time. “What will NOT be tolerated is acting like 2Pac is ‘boring’ or not one of the most important voices for our culture.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/03/lil-xan-charged-200k-for-feature-by-playboi-carti-copycat-250x142.jpg alt="Lil Xan Charged $200K For Feature By Playboi Carti Copycat: ‘That’s Crazy!’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Lil Xan Charged $200K For Feature By Playboi Carti Copycat: ‘That’s Crazy!’</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>March 21, 2023</p></a><p>Lil Xan wasn’t without his supporters, though, as California’s own <a href=# rel=noopener>Glasses Malone</a> said he “can see how a [millennial] may think Tupac’s music is boring!” while arguing that Xan is “part of the culture,” whether critics like it or not.</p><p>Hs U-turn on his 2Pac comments come as the 26-year-old attempts to get his career back on track after his <a class=underline-link href=#>Born Dead Tour fell apart last summer</a>.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The Redlands, California native contentiously dropped out&nbsp;of the tour, accusing opening acts&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Dropout Kings</a>&nbsp;of “taking advantage” of him by failing to provide him with proper travel arrangements for the 17-date run.</p><p>In response, the <a class=underline-link href=#>Dropout Kings told&nbsp;HipHopDX&nbsp;that Xan’s claims had no merit,</a>&nbsp;and that he had left them high and dry on the tour’s opening date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mijoqRdra6vedGenqudpKh6c7zAnGSbp6Keu6h5wqikpp2eqcA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./snow-tha-product.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Snow Tha Product Height, Weight, Age, Family, Children</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./leah-messer-jeremy-calvert-discuss-marriage-on-teen-mom-2-w202837.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Leah Messer, Jeremy Calvert Discuss Marriage on Teen Mom 2</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
