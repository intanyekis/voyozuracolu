In recent years, the buzz surrounding the actress and businesswoman has been about her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">divorce from Chris Martin</a>&nbsp;and her 2018 wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who does Paltrow hang out with</a> if not everyone loves her? People have always said that she and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyonce </a></strong>are super close, which is exciting to hear since it's not possible to think of two bigger stars. But in recent years, people have wondered if that still rings true. Let's investigate.</p><h2 id=becky-with-the-good-hair>Becky With The Good Hair?</h2><p>With the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">release of Beyonce's album Lemonade</a>, fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wondered if Gwyneth Paltrow was "Becky with the good hair,"</a> the woman that Beyonce sang about in one song. As everyone remembers, this was supposedly the person that Jay-Z was having an affair with.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, Amber Rose appeared on a podcast and said,&nbsp;“I definitely think that Gwyneth Paltrow is ‘Becky with the good hair.' They were like friends, and then, like, you don’t see Gwyneth Paltrow with Beyoncé anymore. Now Gwyneth lost her husband, but like Beyoncé’s still with Jay." Paltrow's rep said that it was "completely absurd and 100 percent false."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were even more curious about the status of this famous friendship when Paltrow married Brad Falchuk in 2018 and Beyonce wasn't there. People have said that Beyonce must have not been able to go because of her schedule, which does make sense.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Are Winona Ryder And Gwyneth Paltrow Friends Or Enemies?</a></span></p><h2 id=emails>Emails?</h2><p>People say that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the stars started fighting over emails</a>&nbsp;in 2014. According to&nbsp;The Independent, Paltrow was hosting a charity sale on&nbsp;Goop. A source told&nbsp;Heat, "A while back, Bey had donated a pair of brightly colored stiletto boots (that designer Stuart Weitzman made just for her) to Gwyneth's charity sale on her Goop website. But, after the split, she thought it best that her name wasn't attached to the event."</p><p>The source continued, "Gwyn and Beyoncé haven't spoken much since Gwyn's split with Chris, although Bey has checked in on how she and the kids are doing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, the problem was that Beyonce didn't want her name to be part of the charity sale, but Paltrow reportedly mentioned Beyonce's name.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything You Need To Know About Gwyneth Paltrow’s ‘Natural’ Beauty Habits</a></span></p><h2 id=great-friends>Great Friends</h2><p>Even though there has been a lot of chatter of Beyonce and Paltrow fighting and no longer being friends, they have only had the nicest things to say about each other over the years.</p><p>According to&nbsp;E Online, Paltrow had nothing but kind words for her pal in 2015 on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live!&nbsp;She said, "The greatest perk of being their friend, is that I have a relationship with people who are also—who have similar...I mean, obviously I'm not as famous or successful as they are. But I do have a life in the public eye and I have people to sort of walk through life with in that capacity, and they're very kind and loving people. And it also means I get to be around their daughter."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paltrow also shared that their families are close. Her son, Moses, calls Jay-Z "Uncle Jay" and has talked about wanting to "be like him." Her daughter, Apple, used to talk about singing like Beyonce when she was younger. In 2015, Paltrow talked about how much she enjoyed being able to spend time with Beyonce and Jay-Z's daughter Blue Ivy, according to&nbsp;Flare.com, so it definitely sounds like the families hang out a lot.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Buzzfeed, Beyonce said in 2011 that she loved being at Paltrow's home and she would want to just stay there. She said, "You go to her house and she makes you feel like you never want to go home. She is what I strive to be one day." The publication also mentioned that the couples would have double dates.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Kelly Rowland Almost Go Broke By Trying To Keep Up With Beyonce’s Lifestyle?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether or not the two superstars are still best friends, it's interesting to think back how they first met. According to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, it was back in 2006 when they were attending an NYC charity event. The publication also notes that when Paltrow appeared on&nbsp;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&nbsp;in 2010, she said she and Chris Martin, Jay-Z, and Beyonce were "really close."</p><p>It sounds like even with a lot of talk about Beyonce and Gwyneth Paltrow fighting with one another, their friendship has lasted for years and doesn't show any sign of slowing down. At least that's what fans can hope, as fans of both stars love the idea of them hanging out all the time and getting their families together for casual dinners at Paltrow's beautiful home.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z Treats Wife Beyoncé To A Luxury Dinner In Italy In Newly Emerged Pictures</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brPWsqWerJhivaK406umsGWRo7FursSypqeblah6p77InqWdq5ievXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aya-omasa-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-220752-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aya masa Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./glorilla-jt-address-rumored-beef-on-twitter-1234867988.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>GloRilla And JT Address Beef In Heated Exchange Online</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
