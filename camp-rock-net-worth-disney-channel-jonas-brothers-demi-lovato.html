Between the less-than-perfect acting, the catchy tunes, and the stereotypical underdog-and-mean-girl story line, <a href=#>this movie was a favorite among Disney fans</a>.</p><p>After over a decade, we’re curious… which cast member has the highest net worth today? The actors came to set with different levels of experience and have since gone in several different directions.

While at first it was just one-time roles here and there, she quickly got cast as characters that most millennials would recognize. As the voice of Sunset Boulevardez in Proud Family and Paulina in Danny Phantom to playing the non-magic mom in Wizards of Waverly Place, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maria has a current net worth of $2 million</a>.</p><h2 id=meaghan-jette-martin-tess---2-5-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Meaghan Jette Martin (Tess) - $2.5 million</span></h2><p>Meaghan had only started acting professionally <a href=#>a year before Camp Rock was released</a>. Since then, she has been acting regularly in shorts and television shows, with occasional appearances in movies. Martin has continued acting through 2021, but it has mostly been in shorts and as a voice actor in different video games. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These opportunities have given her a $2.5 million net worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kevin-jonas-jason---25-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kevin Jonas (Jason) - $25 million</span></h2><p>Kevin, who is most known for his part in the Jonas Brothers band, <a href=#>has actually been credited for a fair amount of work</a> outside of his band’s music videos. Besides Camp Rock, he (along with his brothers) voiced the Cherubs in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, starred in JONAS with his siblings, and most recently appeared in an episode of the TV show Dash & Lily.
