Given you'd love to be spared <a href=#>extra details</a> like image rights and persona, the actress's commercial value all boils down to licensing privileges. These were most recently granted American Jewelry retailer, Zales, for its Marilyn Monroe collection. The trademark is an excellent addition to previous other deals with the likes of Chanel and Christian Dior.</p><p>Just 5 of the 52 celebrities to have featured on the list since 2001 have been women, including model Bettie Page, British-American actress Elizabeth Taylor, singer-songwriters Whitney Houston and Jenni Rivera. Monroe retains her 8th position in this year's ranking.</p><h2 id=john-lennon-14-million>John Lennon: $14 million</h2><p>Great music never dates. It's no&nbsp;stroke of good luck&nbsp;Abbey Road&nbsp;still&nbsp;sounds unbelievably&nbsp;outstanding&nbsp;50 years on. An&nbsp;expanded anniversary edition of the&nbsp;Beatles' penultimate release returned to the top of the official UK Album chart in October. It took the&nbsp;breathless, high-energy flow of Kirk (DaBaby) and&nbsp;the charm of a highly successful Post Malone third album,&nbsp;Hollywood's Bleeding, to keep the&nbsp;former No. 1 album in 3rd place on the Billboard 200 in the US.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Creepy Details About The Demise Of John Lennon</a></span></p><p>Abbey Road's popularity across digital and streaming platforms rubbed off on Lennon's catalog. It enjoyed a 52% boost in album-equivalents sales in the U.S., says Forbes. The decision to finally have his solo catalog on streaming platforms in 2014 proved the turning point in the former co-lead vocalist's popularity among Millennials.</p><h2 id=dr-seuss-19-million>Dr. Seuss:&nbsp;$19 million</h2><p>We're in an era when everything has to churn out money. Dr. Seuss's&nbsp;imaginative&nbsp;children's stories are slicing a piece of the pie, too. His poetic children's books have inspired many&nbsp;animated and theatrical versions, including Broadway musicals.</p><p>Licensing deals with Dwindle Distribution (Almost Skateboards), Universal Studios (Hallmark), Olympia Le-Tan, and many others helped promote the franchise's works to a younger audience, who missed his classic holiday tale like The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adaptations</a> of his original volumes rarely sit well with adults who grew up with his books.&nbsp;Even so, his estate&nbsp;backed the brand's expansion to new product areas and markets with gifting, stationery, apparel, and toys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bob-marley-20-million>Bob Marley:&nbsp;$20 million</h2><p>Bob Marley's music continues to be streamed and enjoyed nearly four decades since he died of cancer. That "money can't buy life" and "death isn't the greatest loss in life" never cease to amaze me. He had a few hits (outside of Jamaica) in his lifetime. Eventually, he accomplished multiple recognitions on the global stage.</p><p>This is&nbsp;a man who once sought to know how "possessions" make you wealthy. His&nbsp;heritage validates his hopes for immortality. His music was streamed in the U.S. nearly a billion times in 2019.&nbsp;Earnings from his music buffered with product sales from earbuds, turntables, Bluetooth speakers, to headphones, are channeled into actualizing his commitment to improving lives through sustainability. A mission fulfilled indeed.</p><h2 id=arnold-palmer-30-million>Arnold Palmer:&nbsp;$30 million</h2><p>Arnold Palmer would go down as one of the most successful golfers the world has ever seen with 62 PGA tour event victories, 4 of them coming at the Masters. His understanding of business was even greater.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Palmer was worth $875 million before his death, 0.4% of that accrued to prize money throughout his 52-year professional golfing career. His estimated earnings this year has been the least since he passed on. Partnerships with MasterCard, Rolex, Textron, and interests in beverages and apparel have held his name in the top half of different editions of the Forbes lists following his departure in September 2016.</p><h2 id=charles-schulz-38-million>Charles Schulz:&nbsp;$38 million</h2><p>Charles Schultz is another consistent name on many rich-dead publications, thanks to his Peanuts comic strips.

A 12-part animation series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snoopy in Space</a>, debuted in November in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the second NASA mission to orbit the moon. The Peanuts gang has impacted Americans tremendously and inspired the younger generations of artists.</p><h2 id=elvis-presley-39-million>Elvis Presley: $39 million</h2><p>Hundreds of thousands embark on a pilgrimage to his estate, Graceland, every year. Millions around the world buy his music. His life ended during a period of unprecedented stardom.
