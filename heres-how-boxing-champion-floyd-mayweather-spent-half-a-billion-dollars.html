Floyd Jr. competed between the years 1996 to 2017, eventually retiring after winning 15 major world championships. Those trophies ranged from super featherweight to light middleweight classes. Curious to see how he spends all his money? Keep on reading to find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Sweet 16: Inside Floyd Mayweather's Jaw-Dropping Car Collection" href=#>Sweet 16: Inside Floyd Mayweather's Jaw-Dropping Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=from-amateur-hour-to-the-big-leagues>From Amateur Hour To The Big Leagues</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Floyd Mayweather Jr. was born as Floyd Joy Sinclair on February 24, 1977, into a family of boxers. Floyd Mayweather Sr. is also a retired professional boxer who competed from 1973 until 1990. Known for his defensive abilities and incredible boxing strategy, Floyd Sr. held a total of 28 wins out of 35 professional fights. Floyd Mayweather Jr.’s amateur boxing career started in the early 1990s, after having won 84 wins and 8 losses.</p><p>He was also given the nickname Pretty Boy after his teammates noted that after each fight, he had very few scars. This is largely due to his known defensive tactics, no doubt ingrained into him by his father and his uncle, Roger Mayweather. Floyd Jr. also won a bronze medal during the 1996 Olympics when he reached the semi-finals of the featherweight class. In the same year, Floyd Jr. won against fellow amateur boxer Roberto Apodaca by KO during the second round.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This event signaled the start of his professional boxing career. Early on in his career, critics and other boxers praised Floyd Jr. for his athleticism, often telling him that he was a prodigy. True enough, his talent for boxing – mixed with his penchant for investments – led him to become one of the <a href=#>most successful athletes in the world</a>.</p><h2 id=carrying-bundles-of-hundred-dollar-bills-in-a-ziploc>Carrying&nbsp;Bundles Of Hundred-Dollar Bills In A Ziploc</h2><p>With great power comes great responsibility – or at least, that is how the saying goes. Floyd Mayweather Jr. currently has a net worth of over $450 million, making him one of <a href=#>the highest-paid athletes in the world</a>. However, his money doesn’t all come from hitting punches inside the ring. He’s also a tech-savvy businessman and an incredibly smart investor. His financial decisions even earned him the nickname Money amongst his peers and co-workers.</p><p>It is reported that he travels with bundles of hundred-dollar bills in a Ziploc bag or inside one of his equally lavish backpacks. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Some sources say that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Floyd Mayweather Jr.</a> spends up to $75 million a year, a habit that he’s picked up on after raking in tons of cash from his fights and investments. Floyd Jr. owns over 40 designer watches, with a staggering collective worth of over $6.4 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2018, he added Jacob & Co.’s $18 million Billionaire tourbillon watch to his collection. The Billionaire is designed with 260 carats of emerald-cut diamonds, an 18-carat white gold case, and its bracelet is set with diamonds that weigh as much as three carats each.</p><h2 id=purchasing-luxurious-items-and-collectibles>Purchasing Luxurious Items And Collectibles</h2><p>In 2019, Floyd Jr. posted a video on his Instagram account showing off his massive wealth. While doing so, his fans spotted another massive sign of his wealth: a Hula Hoop bag from the&nbsp;<a href=#>French luxury fashion house Chanel</a> that was released in 2013. The bag debuted in 2012, but the designer never intended a commercial release for it. But because of the demand, Chanel produced a smaller version – one that still cost thousands of dollars.</p><p>The bag Floyd Jr. owned had a price tag of over $19,450. Of course, Floyd Jr. also owns a collection of expensive cars – two fleets of luxury cars, to be exact. One of which is a Bentley that cost $290,000. Not only that, but all of his cars are either all white, or all black.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of clothing, Floyd Jr. is a very particular man. Reports confirm that he only wears his shoes once, and then leaves them in hotel rooms for his staff once he’s done wearing them. However, shoes aren’t the only thing he dismisses once he’s used them once. Sources also confirm that Floyd Jr. spends over $6,500 a year on undergarments alone. That’s because he throws them out after wearing them the first time.</p><h2 id=floyd-always-lets-the-world-know-he-is-a-rich-man>Floyd Always Lets The World Know He Is A Rich Man</h2><p>Of course, a truly wealthy man wouldn’t be caught dead flying commercial. For that reason alone, Floyd Jr. bought a G5 private jet which he named Air Mayweather. He's not the only celebrity who owns a private jet since even <a href=#>Kim Kardashian owns a luxurious private Jet</a>. The private jet cost him $50 million, complete with flat-screen TVs, luxury leather seats, a masseuse, and his name in bold letters covering the sides of the jet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The jet even features a satellite phone, in case Floyd Jr. needs to make a call while traveling from place to place. Floyd Jr. also likes to make million-dollar bets on gambling and sporting events. It is reported that he spent a $1 million bet on the Patriots in 2011 and a $5.9 million bet on the Miami Heat in 2013. For all that has been said about him, one thing is for sure. Floyd Mayweather Jr. is a rich man, and he intends on letting the world know about it.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;</span><span class=next-single>The 10 Richest Boxers In The World, As Of 2022</span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sporting News</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1pr7ErGShp6dir7DEyKeeZpuYlrqxtc6nZJ%2Bkn66xbrnAsq6emaSdsrN50qmcp6xdna6tsoyaZJuhnKG2sLqMnaalpJGnwHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-make-pizza-in-a-hotel-bathroom.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I make pizza in a hotel bathroom</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./henrik-lundqvist-bio-age-education-spouse-career-salary-twitter-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Henrik Lundqvist Bio, Age, Education, Spouse, Career, Salary, Twitter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
