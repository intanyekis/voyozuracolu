Those who ignore parking laws and/or signs jeopardize safety and risk getting a ticket or being towed.</li><li>There will not be an open container “zone” around Boise State and alcohol can only be consumed at licensed establishments or tailgating approved areas on campus.</li><li>Be good neighbors - use crosswalks, throw away litter in receptacles and respect the safety and cleanliness of homes and businesses in the BSU area.</li></ul><p><strong>Alcohol Advisory:</strong> Officers want to remind citizens to have fun responsibly. Officers are advising citizens and area businesses to check ID's and not to provide alcohol to those under the legal drinking age of 21. For public safety, Boise Police will be checking for illegal alcohol with an emphasis on the neighborhoods just south of campus. Officers will also be looking for related problems like disorderly conduct, underage drinking, drunk driving, assaults, urinating in public, loud parties, and littering.</p><p><strong>Shuttle:</strong> The Downtown Boise Association has coordinated free shuttle buses from several convenient downtown locations to Albertson’s Stadium. The free shuttle starts at 3:00 pm and runs every 15 minutes until one hour after the concert ends. Click here for details.</p><p>The downtown Boise shuttle stops at:</p><ul><li>6th & Grove</li><li>8th & Main</li><li>8th between Idaho & Bannock</li><li>8th & Broad</li><li>River Street between 12th & Ash</li></ul><p><strong>Neighborhoods / Public Streets: </strong>To preserve neighborhood and public safety, officers will be watching for parked vehicles that pose a safety hazard, such as those parked blocking sidewalks, crosswalks and fire hydrants, or parked too close to intersections or stop signs. Both Idaho State and Boise City codes prohibit the following hazardous parking:</p><ul><li>Within 30 feet of a stop sign or yield sign;</li><li>Within 20 feet of a crosswalk-marked or unmarked-at an intersection;</li><li>Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant;</li><li>On a sidewalk;</li><li>On a yellow or red "no parking" curb.</li><li>These laws apply to all motor vehicles, including motorcycles and scooters.</li></ul><p>PENALTIES:</p><ul><li>Citation: most parking tickets carry a fine of approximately $60.</li><li>Towing: motorists risk their vehicle being towed if the vehicle is parked blocking a driveway, access way, fire hydrant, or parked illegally in an alleyway.</li></ul><p><strong>Parking in Parks:</strong> The Boise Police Department and Boise Parks and Recreation Department want to remind drivers that all vehicles must be parked legally within Julia Davis Park, Ann Morrison Park, Idaho Fallen Firefighters Memorial Park and Kristin Armstrong Municipal Park.</p><p>Parking will be available Friday and Saturday starting at 5 p.m. in the above park locations on a first come, first served basis. Cars must be removed from the park by 10 a.m. the morning following each concert (Saturday and Sunday morning). Cars parked illegally in Boise parks will be towed.</p><p>Glass beverage containers are prohibited in all City of Boise parks. Any other glass must be removed from the park by visitors and can’t be deposited in the trash.</p><p>Alcohol policies vary at park locations including Ann Morrison Park and Kristin Armstrong Municipal Park. A permit and a reservation are required to have alcohol in Julia Davis Park. In addition, alcohol is not allowed at any time within 250 feet of the Greenbelt. Limited reservation sites are also available for a fee and in some cases, a permit is needed for alcohol consumption at a reserved shelter.</p><p>For more information on safety regulations, park reservations and policies, visit cityofboise.org/parks or call 208-608-7600 if you have further questions.</p><p><strong>Ride Share services:</strong> There is a designated Taxi, Uber and Lyft drop-off and pick-up zone on S. Euclid Ave just south of Albertsons Stadium.</p><p>The goal of police advisories and patrols is to keep residents safe and to maintain the cleanliness and safety of the neighborhoods surrounding the BSU campus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmpaeTlrlws8Crq6Flkqe8sLfSZqurmZabtqR5wKebZqiRp7iqusZmp6WZnqh6p7vRZpilmpWnwbS7zaxkrKyRmba2uQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./israel-launches-missile-attack-on-isfahan-in-response-to-iran-assault.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Israel launches missile attack on Isfahan in response to Iran assault</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blythe-danner.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blythe Danner</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
