They survived the Motown Night and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Disney 100 Night eliminations</a>. Over the course of season 32, Xochitl and Val have continued to wow us with their performances.

She’s only 17 years old, but she’s already taking Hollywood and the ballroom by storm. <strong>Hollywood Life</strong> has rounded up everything you need to know about Xochitl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/dwts-finale-recap-embed-5.jpg><h2>Xochitl Made Her MCU Debut in the Doctor Strange Sequel</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Xochitl played America Chavez in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which was released in 2022. America has the ability to jump between the Multiverse, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wanda/Scarlet Witch</a> attempts to take America’s powers in the film. America is a queer Latina who was raised by two mothers. America is the MCU’s first Latina LGBTQ+ character.</p><h2>Xochitl Rose to Fame on The Baby-Sitters Club</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Xochitl <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>played Dawn Schafer</a> in the first season of Netflix’s The Baby-Sitters Club. She had to leave the show ahead of its second season after getting her role in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. “It was sad that I could only do one season of&nbsp;The Baby-Sitters Club&nbsp;since I obviously wanted to do the second season, but both the show and&nbsp;Doctor Strange were filming at the same time. It was during [peak] COVID, so I couldn’t fly from England to Canada. I was really bummed out,” Xochitl told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Seventeen</a>. Prior to Doctor Strange, Xochitl appeared in TV shows like Raven’s Home, You’re the Worst, and Gentified.</p><h2>Xochitl Is Experienced in Martial Arts</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Xochitl is a fan of martial arts, which she started before The Baby-Sitters Club. While auditioning for Doctor Strange, the actress revealed to Seventeen that she did “kickboxing and stunt tumbling every other day for a couple of hours. It was intense, but I felt like it was necessary because if I got to the next stage, I didn’t wanna do a little and be nervous.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/xochitl-gomez-update-embed-2.jpg><h2>Xochitl Has Dyslexia</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>The actress revealed she is dyslexic in an interview about how she prepared for her role in Doctor Strange 2. “It’s kind of the same preparation I do for all my auditions. I get the slides and go over them and over them because I have dyslexia, so in order for me to not fumble around, I have to really actually know the material,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People Chica</a>.</p><h2>Xochitl Is Bilingual</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Xochitl’s dad is from Mexico, and she told People Chica that she “grew up with a lot of Mexican influences because all the kids I played with and my babysitter was from Mexico. My parents speak Spanish at home, so I feel like I’ve lived in both worlds, and that has shaped who I am as a person.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LFsK%2FHoqulZZekuqbGjG1ua29na31w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./burberry-quilted-jacket-sale-nordstrom.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>You Can Buy a Burberry Quilted Jacket on Sale Right Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-ryan-grantham-and-mother-barbara-waite-parents-names.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Ryan Grantham And Mother Barbara Waite?- Parents Names</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
