Garfield was brilliant in the film, and now that he's <a href=#>moved on from playing Spidey</a>, people want to learn more about his time as the famed Webslinger.</p><p>Let's take a look back at Andrew Garfield's time in the Amazing Spider-Man franchise and learn just how much he was pulling down to play one of the most beloved superheroes in history.</p><h2 id=andrew-garfield-is-an-underrated-spider-man>Andrew Garfield Is An Underrated Spider-Man</h2><p>For two underrated movies, Andrew Garfield brilliantly played Peter Parker on the big screen. Garfield was a huge Spider-Man fan growing up, and he dished on what it was like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to play a character</a> he grew up loving.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don’t know about reincarnation, and if there is one opportunity for me to be alive, and I get offered the opportunity to do a prolonged dress-up as my favorite character of all time, there’s no way I can say no. And, yeah, the only thing that I knew was going to be a challenge was the fame aspect, and I knew that a lot of good would come with that as well," Garfield said.</p><p>"I knew it was going to provide a gilded prison… As a creative person, I knew I would have to balance it out with theatre, and with waiting for the right movies to come along that would make sure that I stayed an actor, rather than this idea of a movie star. I love movie stars. I love The Rock. I fucking love Tom Cruise. This is in no way a detriment to them," he continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After appearing in 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home, fans got a chance to remember just how great Andrew's version of the character truly is. It made many fans go back and rewatch his movies, and this had them wondering about Garfield's time playing the character and how much he was paid to play Spider-Man. After all, superhero actors are known to make millions of dollars for each film.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch Says It's Time For New Superheroes After 'Spider-Man: No Way Home'</a></span></p><h2 id=he-made-500-000-for-39-the-amazing-spider-man-39>He Made $500,000 For 'The Amazing Spider-Man'</h2><p>According to Deadline, Andrew Garfield made $500,000 for his first time playing Spider-Man. This might not seem like a lot at first blush, but it's on par with a lot of other initial superhero salaries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hindustan Times</a> noted that "Robert Downey Jr was paid just $500000 for his starring role in the first Iron Man film in 2008. He made round $2.5 million including his cut of the profits. Downey later made $50 million for the first Avengers film, and around $80 million for Avengers: Age of Ultron. Chris Evans was paid $1 million for the first Captain America film, but since Captain America: Civil War, has been making $15 million per film. Chris Hemsworth was paid even less for the first Thor film -- $150000 -- but made $15 million for Thor: Ragnarok."</p><p>As you can see, an actor's salary can drastically increase as they continue playing a superhero after getting a smaller first check.</p><p>Fortunately, Garfield would get another crack at playing Peter Parker, and his pay would see an increase for the second film.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Did 'Spider-Man' Increase Zendaya's Already Insane Net Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-made-1-million-for-the-sequel>He Made $1 Million For The Sequel</h2><p>For the second Amazing Spider-Man movie, Andrew Garfield was paid a cool $1 million, doubling his check from the first film. Garfield likely made a lot more, especially if he pocketed some of the film's profits.</p><p>That second film, release in 2014, made just north of $700 million at the box office. Despite this, it was not enough to keep the franchise rolling, and soon enough, Sony put an end to Garfield's time as the character.</p><p>Fans were disappointed that a third Amazing Spider-Man movie was made, but it did give way to Sony and Disney working together to bring Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man into the MCU.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Per StyleCaster, Garfield was once again going to double his superhero salary for a third Amazing Spider-Man movie. Sadly, this movie never came to pass, but with a renewed interest in Garfield's version of the character, maybe we will get to see him again!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To James Cameron's 'Spider-Man' Movie With Leonardo DiCaprio?</a></span></p><p>Andrew Garfield made some good money playing Spider-Man on the big screen, and we would love nothing more than to see him suit up one more time.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Do Andrew Garfield And Tom Holland's 'Spider-Man' Stunt Doubles Look Like?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5yimsRus8CrnaKdnJnAbq3MmrGippdiwLG1w56pZqWRo3q0rcuaqbJloprDpq3Lnpto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blythe-danner.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blythe Danner</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./love-and-death-on-hbo-max-did-betty-gores-ex-husband-allan-gore-remarry.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Love and Death' on HBO Max: Did Betty Gores ex-husband Allan Gore remarry?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
