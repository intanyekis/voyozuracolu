He pondered aloud, "Could I still do it? Yeah, I think I could for a while."</p><p>However, he acknowledged the desire to pursue other interests, adding, "There's also other things in life we'd like to do." He mentioned his retirement plans, humorously stating he would be content spending his time doing "crossword puzzles and playing with his grandchildren."</p><p>Reflecting on his career, Pat shared, "I'm enjoying this last year. It's been a great 40 years. I'm looking forward to whatever is ahead."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to Maggie, Pat and his wife, Lesly Brown, have a son named Patrick. Like his sister, Patrick does not yet have children for their grandfather to play with, a fact that Pat lightheartedly alluded to during the interview. Sajak joked, "Hint. Hint. Hint. No pressure," prompting Maggie to laugh and smile at the camera.</p><h2 id=why-ryan-seacrest-is-a-controversial-lsquo-wheel-of-fortune-rsquo-host>Why Ryan Seacrest Is A Controversial ‘Wheel of Fortune’ Host</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/copy-of-untitled-10-1.jpg><p>Ryan Seacrest will be stepping into Pat’s shoes as his replacement, which may not be a surprise given Ryan’s long history as a T.V. host, including for shows like American Idol.
