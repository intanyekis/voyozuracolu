For over four decades now, audiences&nbsp;have&nbsp;been enraptured by the musical that brought the unforgettable Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson together. And after all these years, we can't get the Sandy that was dressed in an all-black skintight outfit out of our heads - yes, she's still the one we want!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why is Twitter Not Okay With A 'Grease' Prequel?</a></span></p><p>Even though we haven't seen Newton-John on the big screen in a while, her iconic role is engrained in our minds. Alas, the Australian Grammy winner has been way busier than we think. If you're hopelessly devoted to Newton-John, you can find out all she's been up to in recent years below.</p><h2 id=the-c-word><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The C Word</span></h2><p>At 72, the beloved Grease star is going through her third cancer treatment.</p><p>In 2017, Newton-John received the terrible news that she was diagnosed with&nbsp;stage 4 metastatic breast cancer.&nbsp;The news was even more tragic as it's her third bout with cancer. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closer Weekly</a>, she was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992, then in 2013, and for decades now she has tried to treat the disease with various methods, including chemotherapy and radiation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-a-fighter><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She's A Fighter</span></h2><p>Living with cancer isn't easy, but Newton-John is a trooper! The unstoppable star has been fighting and thriving for over two decades now, despite her latest stage 4 diagnosis.</p><p>Newton-John has been nothing short of inspiring. She has kept a positive attitude throughout, and in a recent interview on The One Show, she pointed out that she's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"feeling wonderful."</a> Not even cancer can stop the "Hopelessly Devoted to You" singer from being optimistic. She said of her stage 4 cancer,&nbsp;"Oh no, I'm fine, I just â€“ listen, I was dealing with metastatic breast cancer for the last seven years but I feel great."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cancer-charity><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Cancer Charity</span></h2><p>She's unstoppable!</p><p>Newton-John has taken a bad situation and turned it into something good. A cancer patient herself, ONJ founded the Olivia Newton-John Foundation late last year to fund research for treatments and therapies to cure cancer. Having gone through so many struggles with the different types of treatments, the icon told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Morning America</a> why she decided to launch a foundation.</p><p>"I've always thought, 'Gosh, wouldn't it be wonderful if we could create kinder therapies that help boost the body's immune system instead of knocking us down?'" she said.</p><p>Her ongoing efforts are incredible!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mother-daughter-time><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mother-Daughter Time</span></h2><p>The pandemic forced many families to spend a lot more time together, while others were torn apart.</p><p>Newton-John and her daughter Chloe&nbsp;Lattanzi, who she had from her marriage to her ex-husband, have always been inseparable. The duo share a tight bond, however, when the quarantine came around, they became much closer as they lived through it together in California.</p><p>The busy mother saw the quarantine as a blessing in disguise for herself and her daughter. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, "I worked my whole life, and the longest period I can remember being home was my pregnancy with Chloe and the first year or two of her life, so it's been wonderful reconnecting with my baby. She is my reason to be." So precious!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-day-in-the-life-of-onj><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>A Day In The Life Of ONJ</span></h2><p>What does a typical day look like for the mother-daughter duo?</p><p>The talented ladies really take advantage of every hour of every day when they're together. On Newton-John's picturesque California ranch, one can find beautiful miniature horses, and both Newton-John and Lattanzi showing them love. For Newton-John, serenity is being out in nature and hearing the birds chirp. Spending time in the outdoors alongside her daughter has been her healing force for the last year and a half.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Much Olivia-Newton John Sold Her 'Grease' Pants For</a></span></p><h2 id=a-duet><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>A Duet</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides enjoying their quiet space together away from the city, Newton-John and Lattanzi went back in the studio - together.</p><p>It wasn't their first shot at a mother-daughter duet as they had previously recorded "You Have to Believe." Time passed, and with the trying times the world has been going through collectively, and Newton-John's battle, they thought the timing was perfect to release a healing soundtrack. Titled "The Window in the Wall," the ballad is deep, but enlightening. When Newton-John reviewed the lyrics during the pandemic, she knew she had to sing it with her daughter.</p><p>"I knew immediately that I wanted to sing it with my daughter Chloe," Newton-John said in a <a class=external-link title="(opens new window)" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a>.</p><h2 id=an-eternal-friendship><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>An Eternal Friendship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's been over four decades, but Sandy hasn't forgotten her Danny Zuko that she met at the beach!</p><p>Although John Travolta and Newton-John made a spicy onscreen couple, in real life, they weren't an item. However, all these years have passed, and the two remain incredible friends. Her co-star in the musical became a lifelong friend, one that she holds close to her heart. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET Canada</a>, "[John]â€™s a dear friend and he always will be and you know Didi, also."</p><p>The selfless star was also by Travolta's side when he lost his wife, Kelly Preston, to cancer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Things That Actually Happened During The Filming Of Grease</a></span></p><h2 id=plant-based><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Plant-Based</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Newton-John has recently opted for a healthier lifestyle by alternating her diet.</p><p>Switching to a plant-based diet is just one of her newest approaches to battling cancer. And after having spent the most part of last year and this year with her daughter, who's vegan, it aided in making the transition smoother.&nbsp;Newton-John said, "I've also been eating vegan because my daughter was visiting me and sheâ€™s a vegan. I feel very good."</p><h2 id=holistic-healing><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Holistic Healing</span></h2><p>And that's not at all! Newton-John has been doing all she could to improve her health following her third diagnosis, including a switch to medicinal cannabis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The English-Australian actress, with the support of her husband,&nbsp;John Easterling, has been using medical cannabis and herbal remedies in her fight against stage 4 cancer. And, coincidentally enough, her partner happens to be a plant medicine man and an expert in cannabis. Newton-John said of her husband to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, "Now he's growing medicinal cannabis for me, and it just has been wonderful. It helps me in every area." And she's feeling superb!</p><h2 id=a-family-business><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A Family Business</span></h2><p>While Newton-John is dealing with her ongoing cancer battle, the sweet star is still thinking about the health of others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By focusing on plant-based medicine, Newton-John, her husband and Lattanzi have collaboratively commenced a cannabis business. When the duo had an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Lattanzi answered a few questions about their newest venture. She said,&nbsp; "There are two. Itâ€™s Bio Harmonic Tonic, which is a microbial product to help your garden and your plants flourish. And we have our farm, Laughing Dog Farms. We do everything organically."Oh, and they use their beautiful voices to sing to their plants!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Olivia Newton-John And Her Daughter Chloe Rose Lattanzi's Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecarnJqrlWKupMDRnqqsZZ%2Bhtre1wGalnq%2BkpLtuts6hpWacn567qHnNqK5o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pokimane-brother.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Pokimane Brother, Mo?
