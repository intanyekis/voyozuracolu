A few years back, a former co-star of his leveled accusations his way, suggesting that he had a hand in blacklisting her from Hollywood.</p><p>Let's take a look at what was said about Clooney.</p><h2 id=george-clooney-is-a-major-star>George Clooney Is A Major Star</h2><p>Having been a success in acting since the 90s, George Clooney is a performer who hardly needs an introduction. His career in entertainment has seen a number of peaks and valleys, and through it all, Clooney was able to maintain his place on the A-list while raking in millions of dollars and legions of fans in the process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the big screen, fans have seen Clooney work with some of the biggest names in the business while leading projects to box office glory. The acclaimed actor has starred in movies like From Dusk till Dawn, The Perfect Storm, the Ocean's movies, Burn After Reading, O Brother, Where Art Thou and a whole lot more. He has even taken home multiple Academy Awards, too.</p><p>Even though most people associate Clooney with being a film star, the truth is that he initially rose to fame in the 90s thanks to his work on television. He did a lot of television work through the 80s and 90s, and everything changed once he was cast as Dr. Doug Ross on ER. That was the series that took Clooney to a new level of fame, and it helped put him on the map.</p><p>While on the show, Clooney worked alongside a number of talented co-stars that helped the show become a hit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Aren't Happy About This Critique Of George And Amal Clooney's Marriage</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-starred-on-39-er-39-with-vanessa-marquez>He Starred On 'ER' With Vanessa Marquez</h2><p>ER was a series that did an exceptional job of bringing on talented performers to fill in various roles, and at one point, actress Vanessa Marquez was brought on board to play Wendy Goldman.</p><p>From 1994 to 1997, Marquez would appear in 27 episodes of the show, and she excelled while she was on screen. Most people would assume that being on a hit show would be a godsend for any performer, but this is not always the case. As fans would soon learn, Marquez would go on to reveal the things that took place while the cameras weren't rolling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was harassed daily on the set of ER. Sexual and racial. Daily attacks on my mexican heritage and yes, my p—- was grabbed on set in front of the male driven cast and crew and everyone laughed while I cried in pain in front of a young female PA witness to it. Eriq LaSalle was the p—- grabber. All the other ‘stars’ were the racial joksters. When the PA asked LaSalle to apologize he said Oh but I thought you liked it," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marquez wrote</a>.</p><p>These accusations were incredibly serious, and eventually, the actress would levy a major accusation at George Clooney himself.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>It's Official, George And Amal Clooney's Twins Are Smarter Than They Are</a></span></p><h2 id=did-he-have-her-blacklisted>Did He Have Her Blacklisted?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a since-removed Tweet, Marquez revealed, "Clooney helped blacklist me when I spoke up [about] harassment on ER. ‘Women who don’t play the game lose career’ I did.”</p><p>This is a major allegation, and naturally, the Internet was ablaze with speculation about what went down behind the scenes of ER.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What George Clooney, Amal Clooney, And Their Twins Have Been Up To</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clooney responded</a> to these allegations, saying, "I had no idea Vanessa was blacklisted I take her at her word. I was not a writer or a producer or a director on that show. I had nothing to do with casting. I was an actor and only an actor. If she was told I was involved in any decision about her career then she was lied to. The fact that I couldn’t affect her career is only surpassed by the fact that I wouldn’t."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tragically, Vanessa Marquez passed away back in 2018, and there is no word on whether or not amends were made. Marquez did have a solid career while in Hollywood, but one look at her credits does reveal a steep decline in acting roles after her time on ER came to an end.</p><p>We may never know the full story about Vanessa Marquez's production drop-off in Hollywood, but the actress was adamant that the powerful and popular Clooney had a huge hand in her career downfall.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How George Clooney Really Feels About Russell Crowe After Their 15-Year Feud</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdnLKwvsaeZJykn6S7psWMoZivnV2WeqS7jKyrmqpdl7mir8qloKyslZl6p77OpmShp5yhxri7zp1knqpdq66vsdKsmGalkae%2BtrHZaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./does-borna-coric-have-a-wife-everything-to-know-about-the-tennis-player-dating-life-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Borna Coric Have A Wife?
