In addition to his on-stage career, Gabriel Iglesias also scored himself a number of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix comedy specials</a>, including One Show Fits All and The Fluffy Movie.</p><p>Despite his career and passion for comedy being front and center, Gabriel has always kept his personal life very private, especially when it comes to his relationships!

The comedian got his big break back in the late 90s when he moved up to Los Angeles from his hometown of San Diego.</p><p>Although the comic found himself struggling at first, ultimately leading him to be evicted and lose his car, that didn't stop Gabriel from keeping his eye on the prize. After building a name for himself in the stand-up comedy scene, Fluffy managed to score himself his first television show!</p><p>In 2000, Iglesias was cast on six episodes of the Nickelodeon series, All That, which starred Kenan Thompson, and Kel Mitchell.</p><p>This landed Fluffy with an array of TV roles, including voice roles for Family Guy, Emperor's New Groove, and appearances on the big screen in films such as Magic Mike, and Haunted House 2, to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star went on to become one of the biggest names in comedy, amassing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $40 million!</a> This became possible with his on-stage routines, however, Gabriel Iglesias struck gold with his many film leads including Hey It's Fluffy!, I'm Not Fat...I'm Fluffy, and his own Netflix special, The Comedy Event, which is set to air later this year.</p><p>Although he has lived a very public life when it comes to his career, Gabriel has always kept his romantic life away from the limelight.

Valdez also had a son from a previous marriage, Frankie, who was born back in 1997. Gabriel revealed that he adopted Frankie, allowing the trio to live as a family in Whitter, California.</p><p>Frankie became a bit in a number of Fluffy's routines, including stories touching on the many laughs and heartaches that come with being a father! While Frankie is still very much involved in Gabriel's life, Fluffy and Claudia officially ended things last year after 12 years together.</p><p>Although Gabriel Iglesias nor Claudia ever gave a reason regarding their split, it appears as if Fluffy's time battling depression and alcoholism played a role in affecting his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, the comics life came to a standstill when he had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very public breakdown on stage </a>during a show. With years of constant touring, appearing in countless film and TV shows, all while suffering from depression and issues surrounding substance abuse, it was clear that it was time to take a break.</p><p>Luckily for Gabriel, the comedian kept fans in on his journey to sobriety and a much healthier mental state, all while sharing this his overall health including his diabetes, was improving tremendously.</p><p>While Gabriel kept hush on the reason behind his and Claudia's split, fans figured <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things came to a boil between the two</a>, especially during the darker days, and things simply didn't work out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gabriel doesn't seem very adamant about jumping into a relationship anytime soon, however, his next romance will most likely remain very private, considering his former romance didn't stand the test of time in the spotlight.</p><p>Today, Gabriel is back at it with his stand-up, TV appearances, and his Tapatio hot sauce collaboration! More recently, Fluffy appeared on ABC's The Celebrity Dating Game, all while readying his 2021 world tour, which is set to start on August 5th in Charlotte!</p><p>With so much happening in Fluffy's career, it's&nbsp;safe to say that his love life is the last of his worries, especially considering his breakup is still quite fresh!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Truth About How Ricky Gervais Writes Comedy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmLyuscOimKdll5avs7XEpWSin5yawKqt0mainp2gqHqptdJmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpq12lv6rCwK2caA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./offset-no-biological-relation-quavo-takeoff-migos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Offset Reveals He's Not Related To Quavo or Takeoff</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stephen-merchant-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-189546-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stephen Merchant Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
