That’s when you know. It’s almost hockey season.</p><p><a class=ath_autolink data-id=14 href=#>Pittsburgh Penguins</a> training camp arrives next week in Cranberry, and, before we get into the grind of daily coverage, it seemed like an appropriate time for a mailbag. Here’s Part 1.</p><p><strong>Does <a href=#>Phil Kessel</a> have a Hall of Fame case? — </strong><strong>@dalton_mack&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ah, Phil. Everyone’s favorite free agent. Everyone’s favorite three-time Stanley Cup champion.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>So, does Phil have a Hall of Fame case? I suppose he does. He’s a fascinating study, actually.</p><p>Let’s make the case:</p><ul><li>Three rings</li><li><a class=ath_autolink data-id=1 href=#>NHL</a>’s all-time Iron Man</li><li>Presuming he gets a job this season, he’ll pass the 1,000-point mark for his career</li><li>413 goals</li><li>He’s one of the great big-game players of all time and probably was the 2016 postseason MVP</li><li>He overcame cancer at a young age to become an excellent player</li></ul><p>Let’s make the case against him:</p><ul><li>He’s never been a top-five player in the NHL</li><li>When he was the best player on a team, victories were scarce</li><li>He’s very unlikely to reach 500 goals, which is often (but not always) a Hall of Fame clincher</li><li>He’s never scored 40 goals in a season, nor has he ever recorded 100 points in a season</li><li>I know everyone hates this stat, but he’s been a minus player in 14 of his 17 seasons and has never been a good two-way player</li><li>His post-Pittsburgh years have been a pretty big disappointment</li></ul><p>I’ll show up in Toronto if he’s inducted into the Hall of Fame someday. I’d love to write that article and I think he’s an interesting case. But my instincts tell me that Kessel isn’t a Hall of Famer. He may well have been on track after the Penguins’ second Cup, but his numbers really dwindled in his 30s.</p><p>But then again, if Kevin Lowe is in the Hockey Hall of Fame, how does Kessel not belong? I’m a big believer that the Hall of Fame should be for the true, all-time greats. I don’t put Kessel in that territory. But sure, he’s better than some players who are in the Hall. That’s a fact.</p><p><strong>Any chance Kyle Dubas brings Kessel back for a final go-around? — </strong><strong>@em_dee3</strong></p><p>I just don’t see it. If Kessel had aged better, maybe. But for all that we love to joke about “everyman Phil,” etc., let’s be honest, he doesn’t take care of himself physically the way others do, and that’s why we’ve seen such a substantial regression in his recent play.</p><p><strong>Would the Pens consider load management for their aging roster? — </strong><strong>@AlexMay985</strong></p><p>Every time this question has been raised, Mike Sullivan basically rolls his eyes. So, unless his thinking has changed, I wouldn’t expect the big boys to get any nights off if they’re healthy.</p><p>That said, the Penguins should really think about it. We saw <a class=ath_autolink data-id=deXXidb2XqBmHfff href=#>Sidney Crosby</a> look tired in March last season, words I’ve never typed before. We saw fatigue in <a class=ath_autolink data-id=TYdfcevPtXlaQ4xO href=#>Evgeni Malkin</a>’s game, too.</p><p>If the Penguins are comfortably in playoff position come March — and yes, that’s a massive if, given the quality of the Eastern Conference — they should rest some of their big names. I’m not so sure they will.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=wfs21WC1MyiivfTP href=#>Erik Karlsson</a> is one of the best PP QB’s in the game. So, what do they do with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=JaS3oPDlCVzvWJ8p href=#>Kris Letang</a>? Do they put him on PP2, or run a power play with two point men? — </strong><strong>@Itsspelledgraig&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I believe they will both start the season on the top unit largely because <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Fbeqed1oPnnsuS64 href=#>Jake Guentzel</a> is going to miss most of October. So, who plays where? My guess is Karlsson at the point and Letang on the left wing wall.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The Penguins will experiment with many different looks in camp and in the early portion of the season. We will all talk about it enthusiastically every time it happens, but think about it: They should be exploring different looks with Karlsson on the roster. The real question is what happens when Guentzel returns. Don’t be shocked if Letang is placed on the second unit. He might not like it, but it might be for the best.</p><p><strong>Is this year’s Pens team significantly better than last year’s? — </strong><strong>@TriviaPGH</strong></p><p>It’s definitely better. Significantly better? Perhaps. The top six is a wash with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=yuIvRx3bIZdRQxBh href=#>Reilly Smith</a> replacing <a class=ath_autolink data-id=IQhOMC4PNWGS254m href=#>Jason Zucker</a>. Both are good, similar players.</p><p>The bottom six should be considerably better in the defensive zone and should also be slightly more proficient offensively. That’s an upgrade.</p><p>The blue line should be way better. You’re replacing <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NZdcLKgQBSA1qqkc href=#>Jeff Petry</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WUhQFPzIC1w1aP4a href=#>Brian Dumoulin</a> with Erik Karlsson and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1BmSQLO89WDTKqa9 href=#>Ryan Graves</a>. That’s a huge, huge upgrade.</p><p>If <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WzZ4MSlXqjhcbZDn href=#>Tristan Jarry</a> is healthy, I think he’ll be better.</p><p>So, on paper, they’re a lot better. How many more points? Your guess is as good as mine, but I do think they’re a playoff team.</p><p><strong>Any Karlsson interactions that you’ve had since being on the Pens beat? — </strong><strong>@skiab94</strong></p><p>I’ve encountered him over the years because the Penguins and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=5 href=#>Senators</a> have danced in the playoffs many times. In my dealings with him, I’ve really liked him. Very pleasant. I think fans will like him quite a bit. He can get a little ornery with the media after losses, but hey, that’s the sign of a competitor. I think he’s a good guy and I like him.</p><p>My favorite thing about Karlsson — those who know him better than me in Ottawa will confirm this — is that he never lies. He just tells it how it is. You have to appreciate that.</p><p><strong>What team do you think will surprise? And what team will disappoint? — </strong><strong>@yy67045767</strong></p><p>I could see the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=8 href=#>Florida Panthers</a> taking a massive step back. I give them credit for what they did last spring, but they barely made the playoffs and a lot of things went their way. Still probably a playoff team. Probably. But I’m not sold on them.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The <a class=ath_autolink data-id=19 href=#>Colorado Avalanche</a> are suddenly way, way under the radar. Don’t count that team out. They could win it all again.</p><p><strong>What’s a good story that you’ve heard from Bob Errey? — </strong><strong>@GSnyder5</strong></p><p>I don’t know if I have a story that sticks out, but I’m sure going to miss him around the rink. One of my favorite people. A genuinely good guy and someone whose enthusiasm for hockey and the Penguins is so authentic.</p><p>I’m really not a big fan of this decision, especially that the Penguins waited until September, which makes it really hard to get jobs in the hockey media for this season.</p><p><strong>What is your favorite movie set or filmed in Western Pennsylvania? — </strong><strong>@Expittriate</strong></p><p>Gotta go with “The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh.” Look it up if you haven’t seen it. The cast is legendary.</p><p><strong>What is your favorite wing spot in the city or beyond? Do you even like wings? — </strong><strong>@duffelbagforevr</strong></p><p>Do I even like wings? Oh, I like wings, pal.</p><p>I really like Big Shot Bob’s. They have locations all over the city and they’re terrific. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for in this case.</p><p><strong>Hi Mr. Yohe, </strong><strong>who would win in a fight between Marty McSorley and Jimmy from the 1989 epic “Road House?” — </strong><strong>@kurri_jari</strong></p><p>Well, if the fight were on ice, I’d give Marty the big edge. As I recall, Jimmy struggles when water is nearby, and ice is frozen water.</p><p>But, head to head on land, I’m going Jimmy. He was a born killer and gave Dalton everything he could handle. I don’t know if Jimmy ever befriended guys like Marty when he was in prison, but regardless, Jimmy was a machine.</p><p><strong>I am new to the South Hills area. Which are your favorite bars/venues to catch a Penguins game? —</strong><strong>@B_Bode_72</strong></p><p>I’m a terrible person to ask because I’m theoretically paid to attend and write about said games. Thus, I almost never watch games in bars. So, I’m going to open this one up to anyone who wants to comment below.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>We do have a sports bar or two in this town, so I’m guessing you’ll receive some good suggestions.</p><p>Thanks for all of the great questions everyone. Enjoy the last few days of summer. Part 2 of the mailbag is coming soon.</p><p>(Photo of Sidney Crosby and Phil Kessel: Bruce Bennett / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3Fsb2xianxzfJFsZmlxX2aAcLzEp56uoZ6oerG0yKVkpJ2jqLKtew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./afzal-hossain.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Afzal Hossain</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ulissesworld-height-and-weight-how-tall-is-the-fitness-influencer-have.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ulissesworld Height And Weight - How Tall Is The Fitness Influencer Have?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
