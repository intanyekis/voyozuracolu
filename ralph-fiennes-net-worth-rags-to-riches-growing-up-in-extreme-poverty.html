A perfect example of that is the fact that <a href=#>Kim Kardashian definitely doesn't have a rags-to-riches story</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike Kardashian and her famous siblings, the famed Harry Potter actor Ralph Fiennes didn't grow up in the lap of luxury. Instead, Fiennes grew up in a situation that was far more desperate than any of his fans likely would have guessed.</p><h2 id=did-ralph-fiennes-grow-up-in-a-poor-family>Did Ralph Fiennes Grow Up In A Poor Family?</h2><p>When Ralph Fiennes first became famous, it certainly seemed like he came into the world fully formed. Already an accomplished actor, Fiennes performed for the Royal National Theatre earlier and then went on to join the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ralph-fiennes-looking-fancy.jpg><p>Since Shakespeare's plays are in Old English, his work sounds fancy to a lot of modern listeners' ears. Partially for that reason, many people assumed that Fiennes grew up among the upper crust of society.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another reason why most people assumed that Fiennes grew up with money is so many of his relatives have become successful. Two of the most notable examples of that are his brother Joseph Fiennes and his nephew Hero Fiennes Tiffin are successful actors.</p><p>At face value, there is some truth to the idea that Fiennes is a descendant of fancy people. Fiennes' father was a photographer, his mother was a novelist and painter, his grandfather was an industrialist, and he is related to a Baron.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Daniel Radcliffe Spends An Insane Amount Of Money On This Boring Thing</a></span></p><p>Unlike <a href=#>Hero Fiennes Tiffin who is secretive about his personal life</a>, Fiennes has been pretty open during interviews in the past. As a result, it is possible to know that no matter who Fiennes is related to, none of that means that he grew up around money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, when Fiennes was interviewed by The Guardian, he revealed the surprising truth about the situation the actor grew up in. According to Fiennes, he and his five siblings had to move around a lot, so his parents could get by.</p><p>"The moving was unsettling because it was always related to where my father could get work. In a way it was very romantic. We moved to west Cork in 1973 and we were going to live in this amazing place and my father would do up houses. He was brilliant with his hands. He could do gardening, he could build a wall."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ralph-fiennes-dressed-down-during-a-seminar.jpg><p>Unfortunately for Fiennes and his family, his father was great at a lot of things, but his plans fell apart because of one thing he didn't understand. "He had no experience in property development, so it didn't work out. He didn't have the reserves or the capital."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since flipping houses didn't work out, that left Fiennes' parents struggling to get by. Based on what Fiennes told The Guardian, things got so bad that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he and his siblings had to cope with a great deal of financial stress</a> when they were still kids.</p><p>"My parents were very financially challenged. All of us children have the memory of being told that there was no money, we have to sell this, there's no presents for Christmas. Of being in the front line of that constant worry; the atmosphere in the home always charged with anxiety. 'What do we do? What do we do?'"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does The Harry Potter Cast Still Keep In Touch Today?</a></span></p><p>While no kids should have to worry the way that Fiennes did, the bright side is that his family's financial problems bonded them together. This is how The Guardian's writer Xan Brooks summed up that part of the famed actor's childhood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"On the upside, there was a lot of love. The Fiennes's siblings shared rooms, piled into bunk-beds and scrapped for space. But there were always books to read and woods to play in. They were offered support and encouragement; gently nudged down creative paths."</p><h2 id=what-is-ralph-fiennes-39-net-worth-now>What Is Ralph Fiennes' Net Worth Now?</h2><p>Since Ralph Fiennes, his brother, and his nephew are all famous actors, it shouldn't surprise anyone that the family value the arts. According to what Fiennes told The Guardian for their aforementioned article, it was his mother who started him on the path to superstardom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ralph-fiennes-smiling.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My mother introduced me to Shakespeare when I was very young. One day she sat me down and told me the story of Hamlet in her own words, which left a huge impression on me. Quite a disturbing impression, actually â€“ it's a disturbing story if you're eight years old."</p><p>Fiennes continued, "And then she gave me Olivier's recordings of the speeches. I think I was mesmerized by his voice as much as anything. I didn't understand all of it, but I would sit there listening with a copy of the play."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Pamela Anderson Went From Earning $6.6 Million A Year To Being Flat Out Broke</a></span></p><p>Fiennes then went on to say that his mom was just sharing her passion for the written word with her son. No matter what Fiennes' mom was trying to do, his passion for Shakespeare started there and that is what led to the career he has now.</p><p>After turning heads when he performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Fiennes went on to become a major movie star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ralph-Fiennes-as-Voldemort.jpg><p>During Fiennes' career, he has starred in many highly successful films including the Harry Potter movies. Fiennes' other notable credits include movies like Schindler's List, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Quiz Show, In Bruges, The English Patient, and Skyfall among many others.</p><p>Like most people who headline hit films, Fiennes has been able to demand big paydays for the roles he has taken. According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiennes has a $50 million fortune</a> as of this writing.</p><p>While it seems like the vast majority of celebrities love to flaunt their riches, Fiennes has never been that kind of person. Instead, Fiennes seems to have more in common with his former Harry Potter co-star Daniel Radcliffe who <a href=#>likes to spend his money on something boring</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipmqSgnXqntcSnpZ6rXaOytXnWqKmtoF2nrqi%2FjK2mZqqZmLWmv4ygqaivmaO0bsHPZqCnZZWtwbOxzJ5kqaemmr%2B1xY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./selena-gomez-skin-care-routine-retinol-scandal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Selena Gomez Revealed A Skin Care Routine That People Her Age Are Reluctant To Use</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./barcelona-real-madrid-live-score-updates-result-el-clasico.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Like A Rolling Stone - The Athletic</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
