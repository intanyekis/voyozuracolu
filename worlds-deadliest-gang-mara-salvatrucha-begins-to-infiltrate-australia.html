The gang could be under a different guise and is going by the names “Tiny Devils” and “SPS-13” in Adelaide.</p><p>It is understood they’ve been targeting Australia to tap into the booming (and lucrative) drug market here.</p><p><b>THEY’LL CUT OFF YOUR HANDS</b></p><p>Born on the rough streets of Los Angeles in 1980s by refugees from El Salvador, the deadly gang have since spread to Mexico, Canada and other parts of the US.</p><p>Often terrifying to look at, gang members sometimes cover their entire faces in tattoos.</p><p>They are known to be particularly deadly, and use violence against people who disrespect them.</p><p><a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=5c66a58cdaa65fb6a8ea22c8ef6f018b data-tgev-label=national data-tgev-metric=ev>More than 100,000 members across the globe have joined the group.</a> Some of them have been convicted of rape or murder, motivated by revenge.</p><p>Some members are as young as eight and any new member has to suffer through an initiation of being brutally kicked and punched.</p><p>The gang above all values loyalty and if any gang member proves to be disloyal, they will be punished and either murdered or have their hands cut off.</p><p>There are many members who now live in El Salvador, and they’re so vicious, a separate prison has been set up just for them.</p><p>Those in lock up thrust their hands through metal prison bars and shape them like devils horns and even some prison guards are too scared to go to the cells.</p><p>El Salvador is one of the most violent countries in the world, according to United Nations, which said it had a 2012 murder rate of 41.2 homicides per 100,000 people, and a projected murder rate of 91 per 100,000 by 2015.</p><p><b>GANG ATTRACTED TO AUSTRALIA’S DRUG MARKET</b></p><p>The Australian Federal Police is remaining tight-lipped about the gang but it is believed they are attracted to Australia’s booming drug market.</p><p>The gang has previously been linked to Mexican drug lord El Chapo and they have plans to team up with Australia’s outlaw motorcycle gangs.</p><p>US Homeland Security’s special agent in charge Mark Selby told the <i><a class=body-link href=#>Herald Sun</a></i> it was an extremely violent gang to be entering Australia.</p><p>“MS-13 are opportunists ... We are concerned that (if) they partner with criminal groups like outlaw motorcycle gangs, it will make them more devastating,” he said.</p><p>The gang mainly focuses on extortion and drug distribution and Mr Selby said members “are brutally violent”.</p><p>The <i>Herald Sun</i> reports the gang could be storming Western Australia, NSW and Victoria as well as South Australia.</p><p>Frighteningly, MS-13 wants to be the gang that has the highest number of killings across the world and the gang may have been infiltrating Australia secretly and slowly for some time.</p><p>There have been reports the inked up members are looking for clean skins to join their group so they can commit crimes inconspicuously.</p><p>They first made their presence in Australia known when they tagged a garage door in Bondi with their gang name in 2015.</p><p>Letterboxes and walls in the suburb were also sprayed with bright blue graffiti and residents became fearful.</p><p>Australian Criminal Intelligence chief executive Chris Dawson told the <a class=body-link href=#>Daily Mail</a> Mexican cartel activity had started to emerge in Australia around 2014, which could be a sign the gang is establishing itself in Australia.</p><p>“In July (2014) the Australian Crime Commission was involved in the arrest of two men allegedly linked to the drug cartel,” he said.</p><p>Mr Selby believes Australian authorities will be able to handle the gang because of their experience with the outlaw bikie gangs.</p><p>“I’ve no doubt the authorities will be able to deal with it,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb6%2FOpmWarV%2BjrrW1zqeYpWeTp7ausY6wpquklKh6pbHAnaOinaOpeqitzaBkppmilnq0rcuvmK2qpZi1onnBnp6ipqNiwbB5yKedoqSkp661sYyarKysopa5qq2Op5ywq12owbC%2B2GibnmqVl4Skf5hvb3FrlJmGeIHFcGifaGVogqavk3FqbA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./my-600-lb-life-kirsten.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>MY 600 LB LIFE Kirsten Perezs successful weight loss journey continues in new pics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maggie-gray.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maggie Gray</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
