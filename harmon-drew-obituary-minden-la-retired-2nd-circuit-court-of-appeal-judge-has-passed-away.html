Judge Drew’s death, which follows closely on the heels of the recent passing of 26th Judicial District Judge Lane Pittard, marks the end of an era for the legal community in the region. Harmon Drew, a proud graduate of Minden High School, embarked on a notable legal career that began with earning his law degree from Louisiana State University Law School. His dedication to the legal profession led him to private practice, where he also served as the first assistant district attorney in the Bossier-Webster judicial district.</p><p>A remarkable achievement in Drew’s career was becoming the fifth generation in his family to hold a judge’s title. His judicial journey began in Minden City Court, and he steadily rose through the ranks to the 26th Judicial District Court judgeship. In 1998, he was elected to the prestigious 2nd Circuit Court of Appeal, where he served until his retirement in 2017. Judge Drew was not only esteemed within the legal community but was also recognized for his significant contributions to law enforcement education. He and his wife, Jean Talley Drew, would annually visit law enforcement agencies to teach various aspects of criminal law and provide insights into legislative amendments. This commitment to education persisted even after his retirement, showcasing his unwavering dedication to the betterment of the legal system.</p><p>Beyond his judicial pursuits, Harmon Drew was a multi-talented individual. Notably, he was the driving force behind the “True Blue Drew Book,” an educational initiative that exemplified his commitment to legal education. Additionally, Judge Drew showcased his musical talents as the keyboardist for the Harmon Drew Super Group, a band celebrated for its renditions of dancing music from the 1960s and 1970s. In 2002, the band received the honor of induction into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.</p><p>Judge Harmon Drew and his wife, both esteemed attorneys, were considered “pillars of the community” in Minden, where they resided. Sheriff Jason Parker expressed his deep sorrow at Drew’s passing, emphasizing the judge’s love for his family, community, and law enforcement. The legacy of Judge Harmon Drew will endure not only through his judicial contributions but also through the indelible mark he left on legal education and the vibrant musical scene of Northwest Louisiana.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwtMCrpKimXZm%2FpsOMqJmirKWWv7p5zKKlnZ2eYrmiedGeq6KqlZl6c7rDZpqiqpOqtrV5wqisq6xdpLNurc%2BpnJqkXZ%2FCpbPEZp%2Baq12lrrS%2FxJ1kmq%2BRrnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-old-was-nle-choppa-when-he-blew-up-what-does-nle-in-nle-choppa-stand-for.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How old was NLE Choppa when he blew up?
