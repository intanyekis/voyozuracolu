But then I had similar feelings for both genders so maybe a spectrum of bisexual. Then I also have learned I don’t have too much sexual desires and urges as most people 💀which works I guess because I have a commitment to save myself until marriage 🤣. Which people call asexual when they don’t experience sexual urges.”</p><p>The singer did not choose a specific label for himself, but Archuleta called for religious people to be more accepting of queer people overall.</p><p>“Idk what to make of it and I don’t have all the answers. I just invite you to please consider making room to be more understanding and compassionate <a href=#>to those who are LGBTQIA+</a>, and those who are a part of that community and trying to find that balance with their faith which also is a huge part of their identity like myself,” he explained. “I think we can do better as people of faith and Christians, including Latter-day Saints, to listen more to the wrestle between being LGBTQIA+ and a person of faith.”</p><p>Archuleta was the season 7 runner-up on American Idol in 2008 when he was 16 years old. He lost to <a href=#><strong>David Cook</strong></a>, who supported his fellow Idol alum.</p><p>“Love you man, and so proud of who you are,” Cook, 38, commented via <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>The Miami native’s courage comes during <a href=#>Pride month</a>, which is celebrated throughout June to mark the anniversary of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising.</p><p>See Archuleta’s statement in full below:</p><p>I like to keep to myself but also thought this was important to share because I know so many other people from religious upbringings feel the same way. I’ve been open to myself and my close family for some years now that I am not sure about my own sexuality. I came out in 2014 as gay to my family. But then I had similar feelings for both genders so maybe a spectrum of bisexual. Then I also have learned I don’t have too much sexual desires and urges as most people 💀which works I guess because I have a commitment to save myself until marriage 🤣. Which people call asexual when they don’t experience sexual urges.</p><p>There are people experiencing the same feelings of being LGBTQIA+, (i know that’s a lot of letters that a lot of people don’t understand, but there are a lot of unique experiences people feel and live that make them feel isolated and alone that are represented) who are wrestling to follow their beliefs that are so important to them, just as I have. Idk what to make of it and I don’t have all the answers. I just invite you to please consider making room to be more understanding and compassionate to those who are LGBTQIA+, and those who are a part of that community and trying to find that balance with their faith which also is a huge part of their identity like myself.</p><p>I think we can do better as people of faith and Christians, including Latter-day Saints, to listen more to the wrestle between being LGBTQIA+ and a person of faith. There are more than you may realize going through that wrestle after all the misunderstandings that come with it. I don’t think it should come down to feeling you have to accept one or the other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/David-Archuleta-Comes-Out-I-Am-Not-Sure-About-My-Own-Sexuality.jpg><p>For me to find peace the reality has been to accept both are real things I experience and make who I am. I’ve yet to figure out what that means but I appreciate you listening to this personal matter. Again I don’t feel comfortable sharing it, but felt I needed to to bring more awareness to people in my same situation and let you know you’re not alone. You can be part of the LGBTQIA+ community and still believe in God and His gospel plan…</p><p>For people who don’t really understand how feelings outside of just being heterosexual can be possible and ok I just plead that you be more understanding to people who experience and struggle with things that you may not experience and understand yourself.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>I’ve tried for almost 20 years to try and change myself until I realized God made me how I am for a purpose. And instead of hating what I have considered wrong I need to see why God loved me for who I am and that it’s not just sexuality. So many other traits of who I am come from how I’ve been created.</p><p>If other people choose to live differently than what you’ve been raised to believe is right, please have compassion because it’s most likely been an exhausting journey for them to be ok with the feelings they have and never have been able to change. Idk if they weren’t supposed to try and change the way they were created to be. Even if you’re left with so many more questions with faith and sexuality like me I believe being open to both questions and to faith is how we receive answers. God blesses those who ask. So let’s keep asking and seeking, and having compassion and patience. Thank you for listening. 🙏</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmaaesW6t0ZyfrqSVqa5ur86mnKxln6rBbr7Er5yapKNiwKbE1JqjoqypYsC1vtSgnqWdXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jae-suh-park.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Love Life, Acting, and Philanthropy with Randall Park</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brent-celek-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brent Celek Net Worth - Pulptastic</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
