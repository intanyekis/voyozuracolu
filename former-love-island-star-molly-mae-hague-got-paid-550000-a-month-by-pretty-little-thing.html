It was recently reported that she was making about $550,000 a month <a href=#>as a creative director of the fashion brand</a>. Molly-Mae has announced last year that she just made her biggest career move to date after signing a seven figure deal with PLT in exchange of rendering her service as the creative director of the brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With her salary from the fashion brand co-founded by Umar Kamani, and her strings of brand deals from different establishments, she has now become a multi-millionaire. It was also reported that she can earn up to $17,000 daily on her Instagram account just by posting different brands on it. Molly-Mae has come a long way since starring on the reality TV show Love Island with breaking the record as the richest Islander to date. It was reported that it was always been her dream to be creative director for a fashion brand and PLT made her dream become a reality.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Richest Love Island Stars Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was reported that she has been working with fashion brand PLT prior to her going on the reality dating show Love Island but was only promoted as the creative director of the brand last August 2021. She has been working for the brand since leaving the Love Island villa in 2019. Her current job entails overseeing the high level creative decisions to be made for the brand as well as being<a href=#> heavily involved in designing the clothes</a> that the brand is releasing. The creative directors working in the UK normally earn on a range of $100,000 to $140,000 monthly but the monthly salary of Molly-Mae is reportedly about thirteen times more than the average UK wage for the entire year. This has caused to spark a backlash from the online community but Molly-Mae believes that she has earned her position as well as the money that comes with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Molly-Mae has already an impressive net worth with over a $1 Million of assets as well as a fake tan business called Filter which is widely successful as well. She is set to earn more in the coming months as she just signed a huge <a href=#>deal to have brand collaboration</a> with Beauty Works. She has achieved all of this at just twenty two years old and just only about two years after starring a dating show.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>6 'Love Island' Stars Who Made Millions After The Show</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wales Online UK</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Capital FM</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirror UK</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSzsL7MnqlmpJ%2Brsm610qWYp5xdqMGivoympqWkqWK6orGMoZigrZVitLDAjKmYopxdaoJxfI9pZJplnaS7tbSMm7BmqKKawbXFjKWgraycmnq1tMinnmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-clarkson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kelly Clarkson Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./danica-patrick-stuns-in-a-bikini-after-aaron-rodgers-split.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Danica Patrick Stuns in a Bikini After Aaron Rodgers Split</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
