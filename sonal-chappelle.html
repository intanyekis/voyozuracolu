In this article, we brought you all the facts about <strong>Sonal Chappelle</strong>, who is the only daughter of the comedian.</p><p>Sonal was born in early <i>2009</i> in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in the United States to father Dave Chappelle and mother <a href=#><strong>Elaine Mendoza Erfe</strong></a><strong> </strong>as <strong>Sanna Chappelle.</strong> She has two brothers <a href=#><strong>Sulayman Chappelle</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ibrahim Chappelle</strong></a>.</p><h2>Parents Interracial Relationship</h2><p>Sonal's parents are happily married with three beautiful kids. They share two very different past and cultures. Her father, Dave, comes from an African-American household in Washington D.C., and her mother is from a Philippine heritage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/4/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(10)-1580806513608.jpg><p>The lovely pair met in New York City, but how and when they met is not known. They got married in <i>2001</i> after being in a relationship for some time. The comedian is very secretive about his personal life but doesn't shy away from mentioning her in his specials. He has made various jokes involving his wife and children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/4/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(9)-1580806375979.jpg><p>The couple has been married now for <i>19</i> years and is happy together.

The comic earned his riches from T.V. shows, Comedy specials, and movies.</p><p>Dave started his career in <i>1993</i> as a movie actor in <i>Robin Hood: Men in Tights</i> as Ahchoo. His first job as a writer and a producer was in the <i>1998</i> movie <i>Half-Baked. </i>Even though the film was a commercial and critical failure at the time, it has now been seen as a cult classic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/4/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(12)-1580806998098.jpg><p>In <i>2015,</i> he appeared in <strong>Spike-Lee</strong>'s movie <i>Chi-Raq</i> as Morris and in <i>2018</i> in <i>A Star is Born</i><strong> </strong>alongside <strong>Lady Gaga</strong> and <strong>Bradly Cooper</strong>. In his time as a movie actor, he has appeared alongside many actors such as <a href=#><strong>Bria Murphy</strong></a>'s dad <strong>Eddie Murphy</strong>, <strong>Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, </strong><a href=#><strong>Martin Lawrence</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Jada Pinkett Smith</strong></a>.</p><h2>Walking away from $50 million</h2><p>The actor made his television debut in <i>1995</i> from <i>Home Improvement</i>. Throughout the years, he made appearances in many T.V. shows, though none would put him in the limelight as his self entitled show.</p><p>From <i>2003</i>-<i>2006</i>, Dave was the host of Comedy Central's hit sketch comedy shows the <i>Chappelle's Show. </i>The show featured sketches that he wrote along with <strong>Neil Breman</strong>. The sketches were politically incorrect and a satire to the system in place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/4/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(13)-1580807210669.jpg><p>The show was a hit and was on for two seasons. Before the premiere of the third season, Chappelle left the show reportedly leaving behind his <strong>$50 million</strong> contracts. He left under suspicious circumstances without any prior notice and went to South Africa. When asked about the reason for his sudden departure, he would say that "the game is rigged."</p><h2>Stand-up and Comeback</h2><p>The comedian was always a stand-up at heart despite his huge T.V. show. He started doing stand-up from a very young age in many clubs in D.C. He also had three specials before his disappearance in <i>2006</i>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/4/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(11)-1580806809475.jpg><p>In <i>2016,</i> Dave signed a <strong>$60 million</strong> deal with <i>Netflix</i> to deliver three stand-up specials to their platform; this marked his comeback to the rigged game. The specials were <i>The Age of Spin, Deep in the Heart of Texas,</i> and<i> Equanimity. </i>In <i>2017,</i> he released another stand-up, <i>The Bird Revelation,</i> which was followed by <i>Sticks & Stones</i> in <i>2019</i>.</p><p><i><strong>Also, know about comedian</strong></i> <a href=#><strong>Tone Bell</strong></a></p><h2>Was Sonal In S.N.L.?</h2><p>In <i>2016</i> after the U.S. presidential elections, Sonal's father hosted <i>Saturday Night Live</i> for one episode. In that episode, Sonal was part of a sketch <i>Kids Talk Trump</i>.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Dave delivered the show's monologue in a calm manner, where he asked the American people to give Trump a chance.
