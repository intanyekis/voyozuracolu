Keanu Charles Reeves is a Canadian film and television actor. Reeves, who was born in Beirut and raised in Toronto, started his acting career in stage shows and television shows before making his feature film debut in Youngblood.</p><p>Many people have been inquiring a lot about Keanu Reeves’s parents and making various researches about them on the internet.</p><p>This article talks about Keanu Reeves’s parents and everything there is to know about them.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Biography of Keanu Reeves</h2><p>On September 2, 1964, Keanu Reeves was born in Beirut to Patricia and Samuel Reeves.</p><p>Reeves’ father abandoned him when he was three years old, though they remained in contact until Reeves was six years old. His mother remarried four times, so Reeves travelled around the world until the family settled in Toronto, Ontario.</p><p>Reeves failed academically owing to a combination of dyslexia and temper issues, but he excelled at athletics, notably hockey, in school. He attended four schools in five years, purposely because he was expelled from the others.</p><p>Reeves aspired to play professional hockey, but a sports injury caused him to retire in high school. He eventually dropped out of school entirely.</p><p>At the age of nine, Reeves began his acting career on the stage, initially appearing in Damn Yankees.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He received his green card after dropping out of high school and relocated to Los Angeles to live with his ex-stepfather, a stage and television director. Reeves later appeared in Hangin’ In, as well as various commercials, short films, and theatrical productions.</p><p>In 1986, he landed a role in River’s Edge, which launched his career. Following this, he starred in Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure and its sequel, Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey.</p><p>These films began his acting career, but his subsequent film choices received unfavorable feedback. It wasn’t until The Devil’s Advocate that he started getting strong box office reviews.</p><p>Reeves has also dabbled in filmmaking, beginning with Man of Tai Chi in 2013. Reeves has also written a book called “Ode to Happiness,” which he published.</p><p>Reeves has also produced films and played the bass guitar. Reeves is currently working on a number of films that are in various states of post-production.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Keanu Reeves Parents: Meet Samuel Nowlin Reeves, Jr. and Patricia Taylor</h2><p>Who are the parents of Keanu Reeves?
