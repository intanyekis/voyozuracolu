We have always acted with a heart for people wanting always to strive towards a peaceful solution to any conflict" Jo said.</p><p>"This is a horrendous moment in our history where innocent people are paying the greatest price with their lives. It is utterly heartbreaking and must stop," she added.</p><p>"As a family, our hearts goes out to all those suffering terrible losses at this time and we send untold gratitude to all those selflessly risking their lives for others. We call upon all leaders to find a humanitarian resolution for all," she continued.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Jo Malone refused to comment on her son's direct link to the Palestinian militant group</h2><p>Jo clearly stated that it would be the only comment she would be making and chose to avoid to address her son's direct links to the Palestine militant group.</p><p>In its latest comment, the PSC groups expressed regret about the lack of support they were getting from the university, saying the administration "invests in Israeli apartheid."</p><p>"The ongoing discourse centered on Harvard diverts focus from the relentless carnage in Gaza, a dire situation which our joint statement urgently warned about," it said.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Josh Willcox's fellow Palestine Solidarity Committee member spoke on the controversial stance&nbsp;</h2><p>Willcox's fellow Palestine Solidarity Committee member Sanaa Kahloon subsequently spoke to the Harvard Crimson student newspaper confirming the group had no regrets over the controversial letter and even stuck to the decision.</p><p>Kahloon said the organization 'rejects the accusation' that its initial statement was 'supportive of civilian deaths'.</p><p>Speaking for the group, Kahloon said their mission should be 'obvious', adding the "PSC staunchly opposes violence against civilians — Palestinian, Israeli, or other."</p><p>"The statement aims to contextualize the apartheid and colonial system while explicitly lamenting 'the devastating and rising civilian toll' in its caption," she added in a separate Crimson story.</p><p>"It is unacceptable that Palestinians and groups supporting them are always expected to pre-empt their statements with condemnation of violence," she continued.</p><h2 class=split>What does Josh Willcox study?</h2><p>Willcox studies Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations with history, with his mother telling media, earlier this year, he specializes in Arabic.</p><p>He is also a promising fencer who competes for Harvard and is the only son of the cologne and candle mogul Jo Malone and her husband Gary Willcox.</p><p>Malone sold her company to Estee Lauder in 1999 for undisclosed millions and no longer has any ties to it. The businesswoman set up another successful scent company called JoLoves in 2011.</p><p>Willcox attended the elite Latymer Upper School in London, whose famed former students include Hugh Grant. Fees for the day school are around $30,000-a-year. He spent part of his childhood in New York with his self-made mother who also owns a $9.3 million apartment in a Knightsbridge square, which is considered one of London's most desirable spots.</p><p>Willcox has published at least three articles on Palestine for the Harvard Crimson, writing 'To the Editor: When Will You Stop Silencing Palestine?' in February along with a third leader of the organization, Shraddha Joshi.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKOmrKBdrLatuMKor2arn6N6sLKMqZyrnqWism7A2JymqKZdlrmtscaem6WxXaS7pnnOn2StoJ%2Bosm6uxKGgp5xdna6zwsCrm2afoqTCsb%2BMnKanrKKkw6a%2B0qKYpWWRo8GqecisqZqdnGK5psDTnqk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./veronika-khomyn.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Veronika Khomyn Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sean-lampkin-martin-dead-54-1234743274.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sean Lampkin, 'Martin' Actor, Dead At 54</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
