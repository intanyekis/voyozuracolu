But leave it to Selena Gomez to take her dedication to the next level by sharing her entire skincare routine with her followers on TikTok - yawns and all.</p><p>In her TikTok video, Selena revealed her top picks for achieving her signature glowing skin which included the hydrating eye patches from her brand, Rare Beauty.</p><h2 id=selena-gomes-uses-a-skin-care-product-for-people-50-years-old-and-older>Selena Gomes Uses A Skin Care Product For People 50 Years Old And Older</h2><p>We've all heard the adage that you're never too young to start taking care of your skin, and Selena Gomez's skincare pick proves just that. Retinol, a powerful anti-aging active, has been a hot topic in the beauty industry for years, but many people still believe it's only suitable for those with mature skin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Selena's choice of retinol serum shows that there's no right age to start using this game-changing ingredient.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Selena-Gomez-Sparks-New-Sweatpants-Trend-In-Comfy-Night-Out-Look-(1).jpg><p>But what about those pesky issues that come with aging, like wrinkles and age spots? Well, according to many shoppers over 50, incorporating retinol into your skincare routine can seriously benefit mature skin.</p><p>One happy customer even raved that the serum had significantly reduced the appearance of both pores and wrinkles on their face. Another reviewer in their mid-fifties reported that their skin appeared clearer and felt firmer, while most of them called the effects "smoothing magic" and confirmed that the serum worked wonders on their fine lines and wrinkles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-things-copySelena-Gomez-Takes-Tech-Entrepreneur-Zen-Matoshi-On-Date-To-Dua-Lipa-Concert.jpg><p>Dermalogica's Dynamic Skin Retinol Serum is a powerful yet lightweight formula that gained popularity among users ages 50 and above with mature skin. It has a high dose of retinoid complex and concentrated squalane for all skin types and issues.</p><p>In simple terms, retinoids and retinol both came from vitamin A, and they work by changing the way our skin cells function. As we age, the natural production of collagen and elastic fibers declines, resulting in thin, fragile skin that is prone to wrinkles and sun damage.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside North West’s Friendship With Selena Gomez’s Sister Gracie Teefey</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dermatologist at Stanford University</a>, retinoids and retinol are miracle workers that help boost the production of natural chemicals like hyaluronic acid to keep the skin plump and moist.</p><p>They also stimulate collagen production and prevent the breakdown of existing collagen, which is important for maintaining skin elasticity. And as if that wasn't enough, retinoids also have anti-inflammatory properties that can help to reduce the appearance of acne and other skin blemishes.</p><h2 id=what-is-selena-gomez-39-s-skin-care-routine>What Is Selena Gomez's Skin Care Routine?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Selena Gomez previously shared her makeup routine</a>, and now she showed her skincare routine which kicks off with the ultimate luxury, La Mer's The Concentrate serum, applied generously to the face.
