The Hollywood star married his first wife <strong>Margaret Johnson</strong> in 1953. Early on in their relationship, Eastwood had an affair which resulted in his first daughter, Laurie, born in 1959, whom he did not reconnect with until years later.&nbsp;</p><p>From 1959 to 1973, Eastwood had a lengthy affair with stuntwoman <strong>Roxanne Tunis</strong> which produced his second daughter, Kimber, in 1964. Years after Kimber’s birth, Eastwood and Johnson would have two children, Kyle and Alison, born in 1968 and 1972, respectively.</p><p>Around the mid-70s, Eastwood began an affair with costar <strong>Sondra Locke</strong>, causing him and Johnson to call it quits in 1979. The two weren’t officially divorced until 1984. Locke and Eastwood continued their love affair, but he would also go on to have two children with <strong>Jacelyn Reeves</strong>, son Scott born in 1986, and daughter Kathryn born in 1988. Locke and Eastwood made headlines when they split a year after Kathryn’s birth, but by that time he had already met Frances Fisher. The two secretly began dating and share a daughter named Francesca, whom they welcome in 1993. Two years after Francesca’s birth, the pair fully separated in 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>Right after Eastwood and Fisher split, he started dating news anchor <strong>Dina Ruiz</strong> and proposed in September 1995. The two were wed in March 1996 at <strong>Steve Wynn’s</strong> – a friend of Eastwood’s – estate. The married couple welcomed daughter Morgan in December that same year.&nbsp;</p><p>In early 2013, Eastwood and <strong>Erica Tomlinson-Fisher</strong>, the ex-wife of one of Dina’s old friends, began dating. Dina filed for divorce and the two split in September of that year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Following Tomlinson-Fisher and Eastwood’s relationship, the film director met <strong>Christina Sandera</strong> and the two began dating in 2014. The pair made an appearance at the 2015 Oscars and have kept most of their relationship private.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksK21za1knpmjqcSwu8Nmq6Gqn6q0qXnToZxmsZWWv7R5x6KqZqSZm7Jutc1mp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marlow-barkley-wikipedia-biography-age-wiki-height-parents-birthday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marlow Barkley Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Parents, Birthday</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./camidas-swain-newton-parents-and-sibilings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Camidas Swain Newton | Parents And Sibilings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
