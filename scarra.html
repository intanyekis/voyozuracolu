He had relinquished his position in April 2015 after his team had finished in 6th place at the NA LCS (North American League Championship Series) Spring Playoffs. He had started his professional esports career with a team known as Rock Solid in 2010 before joining Counter Logic Gaming in October 2014.</li><li>While he was in middle school, he was heavily influenced by the emo subculture, a sub-genre of rock music that is characterized by its emphasis on overt emotional expression.</li><li>In his school days, for playing video games, he would use ‘Scarred4Lyfe’ as his screen name. This was a reflection of the influence of the emo subculture on his life. Later on, he had modified the screen name to ‘Scarred’ but his fellow gamer friends would often remind him that its connotations were quite negative. The name, thus, was further modified to ‘Scarra’ which has stuck ever since.</li><li>His parents were initially against him becoming a gamer as they felt that the profession would not pay him enough.</li><li>Other than ‘Scarra’, he has also had quite a few alternate screen names or user IDs, one of which is ‘Priscent’. The first half of this, Pris, came as a reference to Priston Tale, a popular MMORPG (Massively-Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game). The second half, cent, was accidental as he was just pulling a coin out of his pocket when thinking about this. He had once revealed in an interview that he tended to play better in competitive games whenever he would empty his pockets.</li><li>His hobbies include binge-reading fan-fiction and online novels. He is also a fan of Manga, a Japanese art form that often manifests itself in comics and graphic novels originating from that country.</li><p>Featured Image by Scarra / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqyamqqilnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andrew-wilson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andrew Wilson</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./midweek-lotto-prediction-today-february-7-2024-02-07-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Midweek Lotto Prediction Today (February 7, 2024 | 02/07/2024)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cris-villanueva.html>Cris Villanueva</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-brook-lopez-sht-himself-during-bucks-vs-raptors-as-photo-goes-viral.html>Did Brook Lopez sh*t himself during Bucks vs Raptors as photo goes viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-genovese.html>Gina Genovese</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hadiya-pendleton-murderer-sentenced-to-prison-630472.html>Hadiya Pendleton's Murderer Sentenced To 84 Years In Prison</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-payne-net-worth.html>John Payne Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
