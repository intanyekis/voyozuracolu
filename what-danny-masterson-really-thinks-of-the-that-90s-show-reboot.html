At the time, it was announced that Netflix had reached a deal for the reboot, and Kurtwood Smith along with Debra Jo Rupp were confirmed for the series.</p><p>Not only was Masterson excited for the show, but he praised the involvement of his two former co-stars.</p><p>He said in the Instagram post, "This is literally the dopest thing I’ve heard in a decade.

Given his current court trial, matched with a troubled relationship with Netflix (he got fired from The Ranch), not getting to be on the reboot shouldn't be too surprising.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, according to Fox News, his days in court don't seem to be over with, as <a href=#>he's expected to start a new trial over again.</a></p><p>The statement reads, "The District Attorney’s Office will retry Mr. Masterson on the same counts," the DA said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital on Tuesday. "The next court date is Feb. 16 for a status conference. "Motion hearings are scheduled for March 6 and March 27. Jury selection in the retrial is set to begin March 29."</p><p>Masterson won't be working on any new projects either, as the actor hasn't worked on anything since getting the boot from his series alongside Ashton Kutcher in, The Ranch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGius2yZKaZo6mys7%2FOp2SrnZGhubp506Ggp6OjYrynedOhnGasmJbBboWPrGSsoJ%2BserOxwaimrWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cole-labrant-wife-savannah-labrant-married-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Cole Labrant Wife Savannah LaBrant?
