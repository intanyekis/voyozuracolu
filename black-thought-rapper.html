The group’s name was changed to The Roots before they released their debut studio album Organix in 1993. The 2nd and 3rd studio albums, D<i>o You Want More?!!!??! </i>(1995)<i>,</i> and <i>Illadelph Halflife </i>(1996), followed quickly because the group got noticed by DGC Records. After a 3-year break, the group got signed to MCA Records, and albums <i>Things Fall Apart</i> (1999), and <i>Phrenology</i> (2002) came out.</p><p>After the release of a studio album Game Theory (2006), Black Thought and his group members got signed to <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Jay-Z</a>‘s label Def Jam Recordings, which led to release of albums Rising Down (2008), How I Got Over (2010), Undun (2011), and <i>…And Then You Shoot Your Cousin</i> (2014). In 2009, The Roots joined the television talk-show Late Night with <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Jimmy Fallon</a> in form of a house band, which Black Thought said allowed for more time to focus on their music as they didn’t have to tour. After the well-known TV host moved to another TV show – The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2014, the band followed. Black Thought also released his debut EP album in 2018, titled <i>Streams of Thought, Vol. 1. </i>The second EP, titled&nbsp;<i>Streams of Thought, Vol. 2</i> was also released a few months later in 2018.</p><h3><span>Born Name</span></h3><p>Tariq Luqmaan Trotter</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Black Thought, B.T., Roots, DT, Double T, Tarik, Tarik Trotter</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Black-Thought-as-seen-on-his-Instagram-in-February-2019.jpg><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Libra</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Philadelphia,&nbsp;Pennsylvania, United States</p><h3>Residence</h3><ul><li>Philadelphia,&nbsp;Pennsylvania, United States</li><li>New York City, New York, United States</li><li>Tokyo, Japan</li></ul><h3>Nationality</h3><p><img decoding=async title=American src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/United-States.png alt=American width=64 height=47 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Education</h3><p>Black Thought attended <strong>Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA)</strong> in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.
