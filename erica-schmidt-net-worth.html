She’s been active in the industry since the late 1990s, and all of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Erica Schmidt? As of early-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is at , mostly earned through success in her numerous endeavors. Her wealth also increased thanks to the success of her husband. As she continues her career, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Erica Schmidt Net Worth Under Review</h3><p>From an early age, Erica wanted to pursue a career in acting. She attended Vassar College in New York, and during her time there became a part of the comedy group called “Laughing Stock”. She graduated in 1997, and would then work at Julliard as a costume designer. She initially wanted to pursue a career in acting, moving to Los Angeles, but had numerous problems and one day had the idea of pursuing a career in theater instead, and was inspired to direct theater when she saw a performance.</p><p>Schmidt would soon work her way up the theatre ladder, and as the years passed her net worth increased thanks to more achievements. She then began working as a stage director, eventually winning the Princess Grace Award for her work in 2001. The following year she appeared in the film “Miles from Nowhere”, directed by David Pope and starring Caren Browning, and also appeared in a production of William Shakespeare’s “As You Like It”. In 2009, Schmidt directed a one man show entitled “Humor Abuse”, which won her the Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Solo Show, and then directed other productions including “Rent”, “The Sorcerer for the Bard”, “Debbie Does Dallas”, and “SummerScape”.</p><p>In 2012, she moved to upstate New York with <a href=#>Peter Dinklage</a> and she eventually created her own acting company. Since then, she’s worked on several off-Broadway productions, including “A Month in the Country” which starred <a href=#>Dinklage</a>; one of her latest productions is “All the Fine Boys” which ran through early 2017. She wrote the play, a coming of age story set in the 1980s. However, the play received mixed reviews mainly due to the performances of the leads.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that Erica married actor <a href=#>Peter Dinklage</a> in 2005 after dating for a year, and they have a daughter together. According to <a href=#>Peter</a>, Erica is the real artist in the family, as she really loves theater, unlike other actors who ultimately want to pursue film. He calls himself as just “the TV actor who pays the bills”. In late 2017, it was reported that they are going to have a second child. She is not active on social media.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=1.757785467128><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Erica Schmidt</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 8, 1975</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.68 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Vassar College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Peter Dinklage</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Zelig Dinklage</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1765584/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Solo Show</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=7.2984644913628><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>Erica was a member of 'laughing stock' which is a comedy group at Vassar they constantly competed with a rival group each weekend in amazing performances.
